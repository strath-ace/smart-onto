# Migration of Engineering Models to Knowlege Graph 
The code stored in this repository was used to generate results presented at the 9th International Systems & Concurrent 
Engineering for Space Applications Conference (SECESA 2020), a digital event held in October 2020. 
The paper 'From engineering models to knowledge graph: delivering new insights into models', part of the session 5 on 
Concurrent Engineering - Challenges and Opportunities, is available on [researchgate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344451299_From_Engineering_Models_to_Knowledge_Graph_Delivering_New_Insights_Into_Models).

This study makes the following contributions: \
a.	Provides a pipeline in Python to automatically migrate any ECSS-E-TM-10-25A-based EM to a Grakn KG.\
b.	Provides rules to infer a mass budget for each design option of an iteration.\
c.	Trains a doc2vec model on a data set of ECSS requirements to assess past and current missionsâ€™ similarities. (training data set to be added soon provided the original creator of the data set gives us her permission.)

## Getting Started
This code runs with Python 3.7. 
* Install Grakn 1.8.0 (https://grakn.ai/),
* Install Grakn Workbase 1.3.0 (https://grakn.ai/)
* Start Grakn server (*grakn server start*)
* Load Schema *EMSchema.gql* into Grakn keyspace (*grakn console -k keyspaceName -f filepath/EMSchema.gql*)
* To infer a mass budget relationship, load the rules *EMRules.gql* into same Grakn keyspace (*grakn console -k keyspaceName -f filepath/EMRules.gql*)
* Place your Engineering Model .json files into *dataset* folder, our Engineering Models were generated with RHEA's CDP4-Community Edition
* Run *set_up.py*.
* Run *migrate_em_json.py* to populate the Grakn keyspace with your engineering model

To generate mass budget results as in the first case study of the paper, run *queryMassBudget.py*.
To assess requirements sets' similarity, run *assessMissionSimilarity.py*.

When done:
* Stop Grakn server (*grakn server stop*)

## Dataset
The dataset [Dataset of space systems corpora](https://doi.org/10.15129/8e1c3353-ccbe-4835-b4f9-bffd6b5e058b) is available from the University of Strathclyde KnowledgeBase.

Launches for orbital spaceflights, or launches into interplanetary space, are usually from a fixed location on the ground, but may also be from a floating platform or from an airplane.\n\nLaunches of suborbital flights (including missile launches), can also be from:\n\n\n\ta missile silo\n\ta mobile launcher vehicle\n\ta submarine\n\tair launch:\n\tfrom a plane (e.g. Scaled Composites SpaceShipOne, Pegasus Rocket, X-15)\n\tfrom a balloon (Rockoon, da Vinci Project (under development), Bloostar (Also under development)\n\n\n\ta surface ship (Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System) or ocean-based platform (Sea Launch)\n\tan inclined rail (e.g. rocket sled launch)\n\n\nLaunches not into space can also be from:\n\n\n\tthe shoulder\n\n\nA skyrocket is launched from some stand.\n\n\"Rocket launch technologies\" generally refers to the entire set of systems needed to successfully launch a vehicle, not just the vehicle itself, but also the firing control systems, ground control station, launch pad, and tracking stations needed for a successful launch and/or recovery.\n\n\nContents\n\n\n\t1 Commercial launches\n\t2 Launch vehicles\n\t3 Orbital launches\n\t4 See also\n\t5 External links\n\n\n\n\n\nCommercial launches[edit]\n\n  \nLaunch of Arianespace Soyuz, a three stage expendable launch system, surrounded by water vapor from sublimating ice\n\n\n\nSee also: Launch service provider\n\nCommercial launch service providers include:\n\n\n\tAntrix Corporation (PSLV/GSLV)\n\tArianespace (Ariane 5/Soyuz-2/Vega)\n\tChina Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (Long March)\n\tEurockot Launch Services (Rockot)\n\tInternational Launch Services (Proton-M)\n\tISC Kosmotras (Dnepr)\n\tLand Launch (Zenit-2SLB/Zenit-3SLB)\n\tMitsubishi Heavy Industries (H-IIA/H-IIB)\n\tNorthrop Grumman Innovation Systems (Antares/Minotaur/Pegasus)\n\tSea Launch (Zenit-3SL)\n\tSpaceX (Falcon 9/Falcon Heavy)\n\tStarsem (Soyuz-FG/Soyuz-2)\n\tUnited Launch Alliance (Atlas V/Delta IV)\n\n\nLaunch vehicles[edit]\n\nMain article: Launch vehicle\n\nIf a rocket is launched to deliver a payload from a planetary surface into space it is called a launch vehicle.\n\nThere are several broad categories that launch vehicles fall under, including:\n\n\n\tExpendable launch system\n\tReusable launch system\n\tSingle stage to orbit\n\tTwo stage to orbit\n\tThree stage to orbit\n\n\nFor the launch vehicles currently in use for human spaceflight, see that article.\nThere were over 70 orbital launches in 2010.\n\n\nOrbital launches[edit]\n\n  \nISRO PSLV C20 SARAL mission dogleg maneuver\n\n\n\nOrbital launch vehicles commonly take off vertically, and then begin to progressively lean over, usually following a gravity turn trajectory.\n\nOnce above the majority of the atmosphere, the vehicle then angles the rocket jet, pointing it largely horizontally but somewhat downwards, which permits the vehicle to gain and then maintain altitude while increasing horizontal speed. As the speed grows, the vehicle will become more and more horizontal until at orbital speed, the engine will cut off.\n\nAll current vehicles stage, that is, jettison hardware on the way to orbit. Although vehicles have been proposed which would be able to reach orbit without staging, none have ever been constructed, and, if powered only by rockets,  the exponentially increasing fuel requirements of such a vehicle would make its useful payload tiny or nonexistent. Most current and historical launch vehicles \"expend\" their jettisoned hardware, typically by allowing it to crash into the ocean, but some have recovered and reused jettisoned hardware, either by parachute or by propulsive landing.\n\n\nWhen launching a spacecraft to orbit, a \"dogleg\" is a guided, powered turn during ascent phase that causes a rocket's flight path to deviate from a \"straight\" path. A dogleg is necessary if the desired launch azimuth, to reach a desired orbital inclination, would take the ground track over land (or over a populated area, e.g. Russia usually does launch over land, but over unpopulated areas), or if the rocket is trying to reach an orbital plane that does not reach the latitude of the launch site. Doglegs are undesirable due to extra onboard fuel required, causing heavier load, and a reduction of vehicle performance.\n\n\nSee also[edit]\n\n\tLaunch mechanisms\n\tGravity drag\n\tNon-rocket spacelaunch\n\tList of rockets\n\tOrbital spaceflight\n\tSub-orbital spaceflight\n\tSpaceport\n\tList of rocket launch sites\n\tLaunch status check\n\tList of space launch system designs\n\n\nExternal links[edit]\n\n\tCalendar of Current and Upcoming Launches\n\tScheduled and past launches, in principle all from 1999\n\n\n\t\tv\n\tt\n\te\n\n\nTypes of takeoff and landing\n\n\tTakeoff\t\n\tBalanced field takeoff\n\tNon-rocket spacelaunch\n\tRejected takeoff\n\tRocket launch\n\tZero-length launch\n\n\n\n\n\tAssisted take-off\t\n\tCatapult\n\tJATO\n\tSki-jump\n\n\n\n\n\tTakeoff and landing\t\n\tCATOBAR\n\tCTOL\n\tSTOBAR\n\tSTOL\n\tSTOVL\n\tV/STOL\n\tVTHL/VTOHL\n\tVTOL\n\tLaunch and recovery cycle\n\tVTVL\n\tVTHL\n\tHTHL\n\tHTVL\n\n\n\n\n\tLanding\t\n\tBelly landing\n\tCorkscrew landing\n\tCrosswind landing\n\tDeadstick landing\n\tEmergency landing\n\tForced landing\n\tHard landing\n\tSRVL\n\tShort-field landing\n\tSoft landing\n\tSplashdown\n\tTouch-and-go landing\n\tWater landing / Ditching\n\tFloating landing platform\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\tRetrieved from \"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rocket_launch&oldid=906443597\"\n\n\t\t\n\t\tCategories: \tSpace launch vehicles\n\tRocketry\n\tFlight phases\n\n\nHidden categories: \tArticles lacking sources from February 2018\n\tAll articles lacking sources\n\tArticles containing video clips\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tNavigation menu\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPersonal tools\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNot logged in\n\tTalk\n\tContributions\n\tCreate account\n\tLog in\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNamespaces\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tArticle\n\tTalk\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVariants\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tViews\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead\n\tEdit\n\tView history\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMore\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSearch\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tNavigation\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMain page\n\tContents\n\tFeatured content\n\tCurrent events\n\tRandom article\n\tDonate to Wikipedia\n\tWikipedia store\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tInteraction\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHelp\n\tAbout Wikipedia\n\tCommunity portal\n\tRecent changes\n\tContact page\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tTools\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat links here\n\tRelated changes\n\tUpload file\n\tSpecial pages\n\tPermanent link\n\tPage information\n\tWikidata item\n\tCite this page\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tPrint/export\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCreate a book\n\tDownload as PDF\n\tPrintable version\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tLanguages\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629\n\tAsturianu\n\tCatal\u00e0\n\tDeutsch\n\tEspa\u00f1ol\n\tFran\u00e7ais\n\t\u0c95\u0ca8\u0ccd\u0ca8\u0ca1\n\tSuomi\n\n\n\t\t\t\tEdit links\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This page was last edited on 15 July 2019, at 21:30\u00a0(UTC).\n\tText is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License;\nadditional terms may apply.

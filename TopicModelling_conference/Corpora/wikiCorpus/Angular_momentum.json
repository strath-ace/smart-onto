It is an important quantity in physics because it is a conserved quantity\u2014the total angular momentum of a closed system remains constant.\n\nIn three dimensions, the angular momentum for a point particle is a pseudovector r \u00d7 p, the cross product of the particle's position vector r (relative to some origin) and its momentum vector; the latter is p = mv in Newtonian mechanics. This definition can be applied to each point in continua like solids or fluids, or physical fields. Unlike momentum, angular momentum does depend on where the origin is chosen, since the particle's position is measured from it.\n\nJust like for angular velocity, there are two special types of angular momentum: the spin angular momentum and the orbital angular momentum. The spin angular momentum of an object is defined as the angular momentum about its centre of mass coordinate. The orbital angular momentum of an object about a chosen origin is defined as the angular momentum of the centre of mass about the origin. The total angular momentum of an object is the sum of the spin and orbital angular momenta. The orbital angular momentum vector of a particle is always parallel and directly proportional to the orbital angular velocity vector \u03c9 of the particle, where the constant of proportionality depends on both the mass of the particle and its distance from origin. However, the spin angular momentum of the object is proportional but not always parallel to the spin angular velocity \u03a9, making the constant of proportionality a second-rank tensor rather than a scalar.\n\nAngular momentum is additive; the total angular momentum of any composite system is the (pseudo) vector sum of the angular momenta of its constituent parts. For a continuous rigid body, the total angular momentum is the volume integral of angular momentum density (i.e. angular momentum per unit volume in the limit as volume shrinks to zero) over the entire body.\n\nTorque can be defined as the rate of change of angular momentum, analogous to force. The net external torque on any system is always equal to the total torque on the system; in other words, the sum of all internal torques of any system is always 0 (this is the rotational analogue of Newton's Third Law). Therefore, for a closed system (where there is no net external torque), the total torque on the system must be 0, which means that the total angular momentum of the system is constant. The conservation of angular momentum helps explain many observed phenomena, for example the increase in rotational speed of a spinning figure skater as the skater's arms are contracted, the high rotational rates of neutron stars, the Coriolis effect, and the precession of gyroscopes. In general, conservation does limit the possible motion of a system, but does not uniquely determine what the exact motion is.\n\nIn quantum mechanics, angular momentum (like other quantities) is expressed as an operator, and its one-dimensional projections have quantized eigenvalues. Angular momentum is subject to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, implying that at any time, only one projection (also called \"component\") can be measured with definite precision; the other two then remain uncertain. Because of this, it turns out that the notion of a quantum particle literally \"spinning\" about an axis does not exist. Nevertheless, elementary particles still possess a spin angular momentum, but this angular momentum does not correspond to spinning motion in the ordinary sense.[1]\n\n\nContents\n\n\n\t1 In classical mechanics\n\t1.1 Definition\n\t1.1.1 Orbital angular momentum in two dimensions\n\t1.1.2 Scalar\u2014angular momentum from Lagrangian mechanics\n\t1.1.3 Orbital angular momentum in three dimensions\n\n\n\n\t1.2 Discussion\n\t1.2.1 Angular momentum and torque\n\n\n\n\t1.3 Conservation of angular momentum\n\t1.4 Angular momentum in orbital mechanics\n\t1.5 Solid bodies\n\t1.6 Collection of particles\n\t1.6.1 Center of mass\n\t1.6.2 Simplifications\n\t1.6.2.1 Single particle\n\t1.6.2.2 Fixed center of mass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t2 Angular momentum (modern definition)\n\t3 In quantum mechanics\n\t3.1 Spin, orbital, and total angular momentum\n\t3.2 Quantization\n\t3.3 Uncertainty\n\t3.4 Total angular momentum as generator of rotations\n\n\n\n\t4 In electrodynamics\n\t5 In optics\n\t6 History\n\t6.1 The Law of Areas\n\t6.1.1 Newton's derivation\n\t6.1.2 Conservation of angular momentum in the Law of Areas\n\n\n\n\t6.2 After Newton\n\n\n\n\t7 See also\n\t8 Footnotes\n\t9 References\n\t10 External links\n\n\n\n\n\nIn classical mechanics[edit]\n\nDefinition[edit]\n\nMain articles: Scalar (physics) and Euclidean vector\n\nOrbital angular momentum in two dimensions[edit]\n\n  \nVelocity of the particle m with respect to the origin O can be resolved into components parallel to (v\u2225) and perpendicular to (v\u22a5) the radius vector r. The angular momentum of m is proportional to the perpendicular component v\u22a5 of the velocity, or equivalently, to the perpendicular distance r\u22a5 from the origin.\n\n\n\nAngular momentum is a vector quantity (more precisely, a pseudovector) that represents the product of a body's rotational inertia and rotational velocity (in radians/sec) about a particular axis. However, if the particle's trajectory lies in a single plane, it is sufficient to discard the vector nature of angular momentum, and treat it as a scalar (more precisely, a pseudoscalar).[2] Angular momentum can be considered a rotational analog of linear momentum.

For instance, a particle of matter at the outer edge of a wheel is, in effect, at the end of a lever of the same length as the wheel's radius, its momentum turning the lever about the center point. This imaginary lever is known as the moment arm. It has the effect of multiplying the momentum's effort in proportion to its length, an effect known as a moment.

It is a measure of rotational inertia.[8]\n\n\n  \nMoment of inertia (shown here), and therefore angular momentum, is different for every possible configuration of mass and axis of rotation.\n\n\n\nBecause moment of inertia is a crucial part of the spin angular momentum, the latter necessarily includes all of the complications of the former, which is calculated by multiplying elementary bits of the mass by the squares of their distances from the center of rotation.[9] Therefore, the total moment of inertia, and the angular momentum, is a complex function of the configuration of the matter about the center of rotation and the orientation of the rotation for the various bits.\n\nFor a rigid body, for instance a wheel or an asteroid, the orientation of rotation is simply the position of the rotation axis versus the matter of the body. It may or may not pass through the center of mass, or it may lie completely outside of the body. For the same body, angular momentum may take a different value for every possible axis about which rotation may take place.[10] It reaches a minimum when the axis passes through the center of mass.[11]\n\nFor a collection of objects revolving about a center, for instance all of the bodies of the Solar System, the orientations may be somewhat organized, as is the Solar System, with most of the bodies' axes lying close to the system's axis. Their orientations may also be completely random.\n\nIn brief, the more mass and the farther it is from the center of rotation (the longer the moment arm), the greater the moment of inertia, and therefore the greater the angular momentum for a given angular velocity. In many cases the moment of inertia, and hence the angular momentum, can be simplified by,[12]\n\n\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        I\n        =\n        \n          k\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        m\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle I=k^{2}m,}\n  \n\n\twhere \n  \n    \n      \n        k\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle k}\n  \n is the radius of gyration, the distance from the axis at which the entire mass \n  \n    \n      \n        m\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m}\n  \n may be considered as concentrated.\n\n\nSimilarly, for a point mass \n  \n    \n      \n        m\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m}\n  \n the moment of inertia is defined as,\n\n\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        I\n        =\n        \n          r\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        m\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle I=r^{2}m}\n  \n\n\twhere \n  \n    \n      \n        r\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle r}\n  \n is the radius of the point mass from the center of rotation,\n\n\nand for any collection of particles \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          m\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m_{i}}\n  \n as the sum,\n\n\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u2211\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        \n          I\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \u2211\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        \n          r\n          \n            i\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \n          m\n          \n            i\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\sum _{i}I_{i}=\\sum _{i}r_{i}^{2}m_{i}}\n  \n\n\n\nAngular momentum's dependence on position and shape is reflected in its units versus linear momentum: kg\u22c5m2/s, N\u22c5m\u22c5s, or J\u22c5s for angular momentum versus kg\u22c5m/s or N\u22c5s for linear momentum. When calculating angular momentum as the product of the moment of inertia times the angular velocity, the angular velocity must be expressed in radians per second, where the radian assumes the dimensionless value of unity. (When performing dimensional analysis, it may be productive to use orientational analysis which treats radians as a base unit, but this is outside the scope of the International system of units). Angular momentum's units can be interpreted as torque\u22c5time or as energy\u22c5time per angle. An object with angular momentum of L N\u22c5m\u22c5s can be reduced to zero rotation (all of the rotational energy can be transferred out of it) by an angular impulse of L N\u22c5m\u22c5s[13] or equivalently, by torque or work of L N\u22c5m for one second, or energy of L J for one second.[14]\n\nThe plane perpendicular to the axis of angular momentum and passing through the center of mass[15] is sometimes called the invariable plane, because the direction of the axis remains fixed if only the interactions of the bodies within the system, free from outside influences, are considered.[16] One such plane is the invariable plane of the Solar System.\n\n\nAngular momentum and torque[edit]\n\nSee also: Torque \u00a7\u00a0Definition and relation to angular momentum\n\nNewton's second law of motion can be expressed mathematically,\n\n\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          F\n        \n        =\n        m\n        \n          a\n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {F} =m\\mathbf {a} ,}\n  \n\n\n\nor force = mass \u00d7 acceleration.

Note that the torque is not necessarily proportional or parallel to the angular acceleration (as one might expect). The reason for this is that the moment of inertia of a particle can change with time, something that cannot occur for ordinary mass.\n\n\nConservation of angular momentum[edit]\n\n  \nA figure skater conserves angular momentum \u2013 her rotational speed increases as her moment of inertia decreases by drawing in her arms and legs.\n\n\n\nA rotational analog of Newton's third law of motion might be written, \"In a closed system, no torque can be exerted on any matter without the exertion on some other matter of an equal and opposite torque.\"[17] Hence, angular momentum can be exchanged between objects in a closed system, but total angular momentum before and after an exchange remains constant (is conserved).[18]\n\nSeen another way, a rotational analogue of Newton's first law of motion might be written, \"A rigid body continues in a state of uniform rotation unless acted by an external influence.\"[17] Thus with no external influence to act upon it, the original angular momentum of the system remains constant.[19]\n\nThe conservation of angular momentum is used in analyzing central force motion. If the net force on some body is directed always toward some point, the center, then there is no torque on the body with respect to the center, as all of the force is directed along the radius vector, and none is perpendicular to the radius. Mathematically, torque \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u03c4\n        \n        =\n        \n          r\n        \n        \u00d7\n        \n          F\n        \n        =\n        \n          0\n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\boldsymbol {\\tau }}=\\mathbf {r} \\times \\mathbf {F} =\\mathbf {0} ,}\n  \n because in this case \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          r\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {r} }\n  \n and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          F\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {F} }\n  \n are parallel vectors. Therefore, the angular momentum of the body about the center is constant. This is the case with gravitational attraction in the orbits of planets and satellites, where the gravitational force is always directed toward the primary body and orbiting bodies conserve angular momentum by exchanging distance and velocity as they move about the primary. Central force motion is also used in the analysis of the Bohr model of the atom.\n\nFor a planet, angular momentum is distributed between the spin of the planet and its revolution in its orbit, and these are often exchanged by various mechanisms. The conservation of angular momentum in the Earth\u2013Moon system results in the transfer of angular momentum from Earth to Moon, due to tidal torque the Moon exerts on the Earth. This in turn results in the slowing down of the rotation rate of Earth, at about 65.7 nanoseconds per day,[20] and in gradual increase of the radius of Moon's orbit, at about 3.82\u00a0centimeters per year.[21]\n\n\n  \nThe torque caused by the two opposing forces Fg and \u2212Fg causes a change in the angular momentum L in the direction of that torque (since torque is the time derivative of angular momentum). This causes the top to precess.\n\n\n\nThe conservation of angular momentum explains the angular acceleration of an ice skater as she brings her arms and legs close to the vertical axis of rotation. By bringing part of the mass of her body closer to the axis, she decreases her body's moment of inertia. Because angular momentum is the product of moment of inertia and angular velocity, if the angular momentum remains constant (is conserved), then the angular velocity (rotational speed) of the skater must increase.\n\nThe same phenomenon results in extremely fast spin of compact stars (like white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes) when they are formed out of much larger and slower rotating stars. Decrease in the size of an object n times results in increase of its angular velocity by the factor of n2.\n\nConservation is not always a full explanation for the dynamics of a system but is a key constraint. For example, a spinning top is subject to gravitational torque making it lean over and change the angular momentum about the nutation axis, but neglecting friction at the point of spinning contact, it has a conserved angular momentum about its spinning axis, and another about its precession axis. Also, in any planetary system, the planets, star(s), comets, and asteroids can all move in numerous complicated ways, but only so that the angular momentum of the system is conserved.\n\nNoether's theorem states that every conservation law is associated with a symmetry (invariant) of the underlying physics.  The symmetry associated with conservation of angular momentum is rotational invariance.  The fact that the physics of a system is unchanged if it is rotated by any angle about an axis implies that angular momentum is conserved.[22]\n\n\nAngular momentum in orbital mechanics[edit]\n\nMain article: Specific relative angular momentum\n\nIn astrodynamics and celestial mechanics, a massless (or per unit mass) angular momentum is defined[23]\n\n\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          h\n        \n        =\n        \n          r\n        \n        \u00d7\n        \n          v\n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {h} =\\mathbf {r} \\times \\mathbf {v} ,}\n  \n\n\n\ncalled specific angular momentum.

The primary body of the system is often so much larger than any bodies in motion about it that the smaller bodies have a negligible gravitational effect on it; it is, in effect, stationary. All bodies are apparently attracted by its gravity in the same way, regardless of mass, and therefore all move approximately the same way under the same conditions.\n\n\nSolid bodies[edit]\n\nFor a continuous mass distribution with density function \u03c1(r), a differential volume element dV with position vector r within the mass has a mass element dm = \u03c1(r)dV.

Similar to Single particle, below, it is the angular momentum of one particle of mass M at the center of mass moving with velocity V. The second term is the angular momentum of the particles moving relative to the center of mass, similar to Fixed center of mass, below. The result is general\u2014the motion of the particles is not restricted to rotation or revolution about the origin or center of mass. The particles need not be individual masses, but can be elements of a continuous distribution, such as a solid body.\n\nRearranging equation (2) by vector identities, multiplying both terms by

momentum as a bivector (plane element) and axial vector, of a particle of mass m with instantaneous 3-position x and 3-momentum p.\n\n\n\nIn modern (20th century) theoretical physics, angular momentum (not including any intrinsic angular momentum \u2013 see below) is described using a different formalism, instead of a classical pseudovector. In this formalism, angular momentum is the 2-form Noether charge associated with rotational invariance. As a result, angular momentum is not conserved for general curved spacetimes, unless it happens to be asymptotically rotationally invariant.[citation needed]\n\nIn classical mechanics, the angular momentum of a particle can be reinterpreted as a plane element:\n\n\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          L\n        \n        =\n        \n          r\n        \n        \u2227\n        \n          p\n        \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {L} =\\mathbf {r} \\wedge \\mathbf {p} \\,,}\n  \n\n\n\nin which the exterior product \u2227 replaces the cross product \u00d7 (these products have similar characteristics but are nonequivalent). This has the advantage of a clearer geometric interpretation as a plane element, defined from the x and p  vectors, and the expression is true in any number of dimensions (two or higher).

In relativistic quantum mechanics, it differs even more, in which the above relativistic definition becomes a tensorial operator.\n\n\nSpin, orbital, and total angular momentum[edit]\n\nMain article: Spin (physics)\n\n  \nAngular momenta of a classical object.\tLeft: \"spin\" angular momentum S is really orbital angular momentum of the object at every point.\n\tRight: extrinsic orbital angular momentum L about an axis.\n\tTop: the moment of inertia tensor I and angular velocity \u03c9 (L is not always parallel to \u03c9).[27]\n\tBottom: momentum p and its radial position r from the axis. The total angular momentum (spin plus orbital) is J. For a quantum particle the interpretations are different; particle spin does not have the above interpretation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe classical definition of angular momentum as \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          L\n        \n        =\n        \n          r\n        \n        \u00d7\n        \n          p\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {L} =\\mathbf {r} \\times \\mathbf {p} }\n  \n can be carried over to quantum mechanics, by reinterpreting r as the quantum position operator and p as the quantum momentum operator. L is then an operator, specifically called the orbital angular momentum operator. The components of the angular momentum operator satisfy the commutation relations of the Lie algebra so(3). Indeed, these operators are precisely the infinitesimal action of the rotation group on the quantum Hilbert space.[28] (See also the discussion below of the angular momentum operators as the generators of rotations.)\n\nHowever, in quantum physics, there is another type of angular momentum, called spin angular momentum, represented by the spin operator S. Almost all elementary particles have spin. Spin is often depicted as a particle literally spinning around an axis, but this is a misleading and inaccurate picture: spin is an intrinsic property of a particle, unrelated to any sort of motion in space and fundamentally different from orbital angular momentum. All elementary particles have a characteristic spin, for example electrons have \"spin 1/2\" (this actually means \"spin \u0127/2\") while photons   have \"spin 1\" (this actually means \"spin \u0127\").\n\nFinally, there is total angular momentum J, which combines both the spin and orbital angular momentum of all particles and fields. (For one particle, J = L + S.) Conservation of angular momentum applies to J, but not to L or S; for example, the spin\u2013orbit interaction allows angular momentum to transfer back and forth between L and S, with the total remaining constant.  Electrons and photons need not have integer-based values for total angular momentum, but can also have fractional values.[29]\n\n\nQuantization[edit]\n\nIn quantum mechanics, angular momentum is quantized \u2013 that is, it cannot vary continuously, but only in \"quantum leaps\" between certain allowed values.

A standing wave like this can have 0,1,2, or any integer number of wavelengths around the circle, but it cannot have a non-integer number of wavelengths like 8.3. In quantum mechanics, angular momentum is quantized for a similar reason.\n\n\n\n(There are additional restrictions as well, see angular momentum operator for details.)\n\nThe reduced Planck constant \n  \n    \n      \n        \u210f\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\hbar }\n  \n is tiny by everyday standards, about 10\u221234 J s, and therefore this quantization does not noticeably affect the angular momentum of macroscopic objects. However, it is very important in the microscopic world. For example, the structure of electron shells and subshells in chemistry is significantly affected by the quantization of angular momentum.\n\nQuantization of angular momentum was first postulated by Niels Bohr in his Bohr model of the atom and was later predicted by Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger in his Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\n\n\nUncertainty[edit]\n\nIn the definition \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          L\n        \n        =\n        \n          r\n        \n        \u00d7\n        \n          p\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {L} =\\mathbf {r} \\times \\mathbf {p} }\n  \n, six operators are involved: The position operators \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          r\n          \n            x\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle r_{x}}\n  \n, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          r\n          \n            y\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle r_{y}}\n  \n, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          r\n          \n            z\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle r_{z}}\n  \n, and the momentum operators \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          p\n          \n            x\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p_{x}}\n  \n, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          p\n          \n            y\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p_{y}}\n  \n, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          p\n          \n            z\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle p_{z}}\n  \n. However, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle tells us that it is not possible for all six of these quantities to be known simultaneously with arbitrary precision. Therefore, there are limits to what can be known or measured about a particle's angular momentum. It turns out that the best that one can do is to simultaneously measure both the angular momentum vector's magnitude and its component along one axis.\n\nThe uncertainty is closely related to the fact that different components of an angular momentum operator do not commute, for example \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          L\n          \n            x\n          \n        \n        \n          L\n          \n            y\n          \n        \n        \u2260\n        \n          L\n          \n            y\n          \n        \n        \n          L\n          \n            x\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle L_{x}L_{y}\\neq L_{y}L_{x}}\n  \n.

(The \"exp\" in the formula refers to operator exponential) To put this the other way around, whatever our quantum Hilbert space is, we expect that the rotation group SO(3) will act on it. There is then an associated action of the Lie algebra so(3) of SO(3); the operators describing the action of so(3) on our Hilbert space are the (total) angular momentum operators.\n\nThe relationship between the angular momentum operator and the rotation operators is the same as the relationship between Lie algebras and Lie groups in mathematics. The close relationship between angular momentum and rotations is reflected in Noether's theorem that proves that angular momentum is conserved whenever the laws of physics are rotationally invariant.\n\n\nIn electrodynamics[edit]\n\nSee also: Momentum (Particle in field)\n\nWhen describing the motion of a charged particle in an electromagnetic field, the canonical momentum P (derived from the Lagrangian for this system) is not gauge invariant.

The greater bodies of the planets and comets, meeting with less resistance in more free spaces, preserve their motions both progressive and circular for a much longer time.[33]\n\n\nHe did not further investigate angular momentum directly in the Principia,\n\n\n\tFrom such kind of reflexions also sometimes arise the circular motions of bodies about their own centres. But these are cases which I do not consider in what follows; and it would be too tedious to demonstrate every particular that relates to this subject.[34]\n\n\nHowever, his geometric proof of the law of areas is an outstanding example of Newton's genius, and indirectly proves angular momentum conservation in the case of a central force.\n\n\nThe Law of Areas[edit]\n\nMain articles: Classical central-force problem and Areal velocity\n\nNewton's derivation[edit]\n\n  Newton's derivation of the area law using geometric means.\n\n\n\nAs a planet orbits the Sun, the line between the Sun and the planet sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time. This had been known since Kepler expounded his second law of planetary motion. Newton derived a unique geometric proof, and went on to show that the attractive force of the Sun's gravity was the cause of all of Kepler's laws.\n\nDuring the first interval of time, an object is in motion from point A to point B. Undisturbed, it would continue to point c during the second interval. When the object arrives at B, it receives an impulse directed toward point S. The impulse gives it a small added velocity toward S, such that if this were its only velocity, it would move from B to V during the second interval. By the rules of velocity composition, these two velocities add, and point C is found by construction of parallelogram BcCV. Thus the object's path is deflected by the impulse so that it arrives at point C at the end of the second interval. Because the triangles SBc and SBC have the same base SB and the same height Bc or VC, they have the same area. By symmetry, triangle SBc also has the same area as triangle SAB, therefore the object has swept out equal areas SAB and SBC in equal times.\n\nAt point C, the object receives another impulse toward S, again deflecting its path during the third interval from d to D. Thus it continues to E and beyond, the triangles SAB, SBc, SBC, SCd, SCD, SDe, SDE all having the same area. Allowing the time intervals to become ever smaller, the path ABCDE approaches indefinitely close to a continuous curve.\n\nNote that because this derivation is geometric, and no specific force is applied, it proves a more general law than Kepler's second law of planetary motion. It shows that the Law of Areas applies to any central force, attractive or repulsive, continuous or non-continuous, or zero.\n\n\nConservation of angular momentum in the Law of Areas[edit]\n\nThe proportionality of angular momentum to the area swept out by a moving object can be understood by realizing that the bases of the triangles, that is, the lines from S to the object, are equivalent to the radius r, and that the heights of the triangles are proportional to the perpendicular component of velocity v\u22a5. Hence, if the area swept per unit time is constant, then by the triangular area formula 1/2(base)(height), the product (base)(height) and therefore the product rv\u22a5 are constant: if r and the base length are decreased, v\u22a5 and height must increase proportionally. Mass is constant, therefore angular momentum rmv\u22a5 is conserved by this exchange of distance and velocity.\n\nIn the case of triangle SBC, area is equal to 1/2(SB)(VC). Wherever C is eventually located due to the impulse applied at B, the product (SB)(VC), and therefore rmv\u22a5 remain constant. Similarly so for each of the triangles.\n\n\nAfter Newton[edit]\n\nLeonhard Euler, Daniel Bernoulli, and Patrick d'Arcy all understood angular momentum in terms of conservation of areal velocity, a result of their analysis of Kepler's second law of planetary motion. It is unlikely that they realized the implications for ordinary rotating matter.[35]\n\nIn 1736 Euler, like Newton, touched on some of the equations of angular momentum in his Mechanica without further developing them.[36]\n\nBernoulli wrote in a 1744 letter of a \"moment of rotational motion\", possibly the first conception of angular momentum as we now understand it.[37]\n\nIn 1799, Pierre-Simon Laplace first realized that a fixed plane was associated with rotation \u2014 his invariable plane.\n\nLouis Poinsot in 1803 began representing rotations as a line segment perpendicular to the rotation, and elaborated on the \"conservation of moments\".\n\nIn 1852 L\u00e9on Foucault used a gyroscope in an experiment to display the Earth's rotation.\n\nWilliam J. M. Rankine's 1858 Manual of Applied Mechanics defined angular momentum in the modern sense for the first time:\n\n\n\t...a line whose length is proportional to the magnitude of the angular momentum, and whose direction is perpendicular to the plane of motion of the body and of the fixed point, and such, that when the motion of the body is viewed from the extremity of the line, the radius-vector of the body seems to have right-handed rotation.\n\n\nIn an 1872 edition of the same book, Rankine stated that \"The term angular momentum was introduced by Mr. Hayward,\"[38] probably referring to R.B. Hayward's article On a Direct Method of estimating Velocities, Accelerations, and all similar Quantities with respect to Axes moveable in any manner in Space with Applications,[39] which was introduced in 1856, and published in 1864. Rankine was mistaken, as numerous publications feature the term starting in the late 18th to early 19th centuries.[40] However, Hayward's article apparently was the first use of the term and the concept seen by much of the English-speaking world. Before this, angular momentum was typically referred to as \"momentum of rotation\" in English.[41]\n\n\nSee also[edit]\n\n\n\tAbsolute angular momentum\n\tAngular momentum coupling\n\tAngular momentum of light\n\tAngular momentum diagrams (quantum mechanics)\n\tClebsch\u2013Gordan coefficients\n\tLinear-rotational analogs\n\tOrders of magnitude (angular momentum)\n\tPauli\u2013Lubanski pseudovector\n\tRelative angular momentum\n\tRelativistic angular momentum\n\tRigid rotor\n\tRotational energy\n\tSpecific relative angular momentum\n\tYrast\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes[edit]\n\n\n\t^ de Podesta, Michael (2002).

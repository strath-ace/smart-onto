There are two types of angular velocity: orbital angular velocity and spin angular velocity. Spin angular velocity refers to how fast a rigid body rotates with respect to its centre of rotation. Orbital angular velocity refers to how fast a point object revolves about a fixed origin, i.e. the time rate of change of its angular position relative to the origin. In general, angular velocity is measured in angle per unit time, e.g. radians per second. The  SI unit of angular velocity is expressed as radians/sec with the radian having a dimensionless value of unity, thus the SI units of angular velocity are listed as 1/sec. Angular velocity is usually represented by the symbol omega (\u03c9, sometimes \u03a9). By convention, positive angular velocity indicates counter-clockwise rotation, while negative is clockwise.\n\nFor example, a geostationary satellite completes one orbit per day above the equator, or 360 degrees per 24 hours, and has angular velocity \u03c9 = 360 / 24 = 15 degrees per hour, or 2\u03c0 / 24 \u2248 0.26 radians per hour. If angle is measured in radians, the linear velocity is the radius times the angular velocity, \n  \n    \n      \n        v\n        =\n        r\n        \u03c9\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle v=r\\omega }\n  \n. With orbital radius 42,000 km from the earth's center, the satellite's speed through space is thus v = 42,000 \u00d7 0.26 \u2248 11,000 km/hr. The angular velocity is positive since the satellite travels eastward with the Earth's rotation (counter-clockwise from above the north pole.)\n\nIn three dimensions, angular velocity is a pseudovector, with its magnitude measuring the rate at which an object rotates or revolves, and its direction pointing perpendicular to the instantaneous plane of rotation or angular displacement. The orientation of angular velocity is conventionally specified by the right-hand rule.[1]\n\n\nContents\n\n\n\t1 Orbital angular velocity of a point particle\n\t1.1 Particle in two dimensions\n\t1.2 Particle in three dimensions\n\t1.2.1 Addition of angular velocity vectors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t2 Spin angular velocity vector for a frame\n\t2.1 Components from the vectors of the frame\n\t2.2 Components from Euler angles\n\n\n\n\t3 Angular velocity tensor\n\t3.1 Calculation from the orientation matrix\n\n\n\n\t4 Properties of angular velocity tensors\n\t4.1 Duality with respect to the velocity vector\n\t4.2 Exponential of W\n\t4.3 W is skew-symmetric\n\t4.4 Coordinate-free description\n\t4.5 Angular velocity as a vector field\n\n\n\n\t5 Rigid body considerations\n\t5.1 Consistency\n\n\n\n\t6 See also\n\t7 References\n\t8 External links\n\n\n\n\n\nOrbital angular velocity of a point particle[edit]\n\nParticle in two dimensions[edit]\n\n  \nThe angular velocity of the particle at P with respect to the origin O is determined by the perpendicular component of the velocity vector v.\n\n\n\nIn the simplest case of circular motion at radius \n  \n    \n      \n        r\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle r}\n  \n, with position given by the angular displacement \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03d5\n        (\n        t\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\phi (t)}\n  \n from the x-axis, the orbital angular velocity is the rate of change of angle with respect to time: \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c9\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                d\n                \u03d5\n              \n              \n                d\n                t\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\omega ={\\tfrac {d\\phi }{dt}}}\n  \n.

The sign is conventionally taken to be positive if the radius vector turns counter-clockwise, and negative if clockwise. Angular velocity then may be termed a pseudoscalar, a numerical quantity which changes sign under a parity inversion, such as inverting one axis or switching the two axes.\n\n\nParticle in three dimensions[edit]\n\n  \nThe orbital angular velocity vector encodes the time rate of change of angular position, as well as the instantaneous plane of angular displacement. In this case (counter-clockwise circular motion) the vector points up.\n\n\n\nIn  three-dimensional space, we again have the position vector r of a moving particle. Here, orbital angular velocity is a pseudovector whose magnitude is the rate at which r sweeps out angle, and whose direction is perpendicular to the instantaneous plane in which r sweeps out angle (i.e. the plane spanned by r and v). However, as there are two directions perpendicular to any plane, an additional condition is necessary to uniquely specify the direction of the angular velocity; conventionally, the right-hand rule is used.\n\nLet the pseudovector \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          u\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {u} }\n  \n be the unit vector perpendicular to the plane spanned by r and v, so that the right-hand rule is satisfied (i.e. the instantaneous direction of angular displacement is counter-clockwise looking from the top of \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          u\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {u} }\n  \n).

In such a frame, each vector may be considered as a moving particle with constant scalar radius.\n\nThe rotating frame appears in the context of rigid bodies, and special tools have been developed for it: the spin angular velocity may be described as a vector or equivalently as a tensor. \n\nConsistent with the general definition, the spin angular velocity of a frame is defined as the orbital angular velocity of any of the three vectors (same for all) with respect to its own centre of rotation. The addition of angular velocity vectors for frames is also defined by the usual vector addition (composition of linear movements), and can be useful to decompose the rotation as in a gimbal.

In particular, the spin angular velocity is a Killing vector field belonging to an element of the Lie algebra SO(3) of the 3-dimensional rotation group SO(3).\n\nAlso, it can be shown that the spin angular velocity vector field is exactly half of the curl of the linear velocity vector field v(r) of the rigid body.

Ri is the position with respect to the lab frame, centered at O and ri is the position with respect to the rigid body frame, centered at O\u2032. The origin of the rigid body frame is at vector position R from the lab frame.\n\n\n\nThe same equations for the angular speed can be obtained reasoning over a rotating rigid body. Here is not assumed that the rigid body rotates around the origin. Instead, it can be supposed rotating around an arbitrary point that is moving with a linear velocity V(t) in each instant.\n\nTo obtain the equations, it is convenient to imagine a rigid body attached to the frames and consider a coordinate system that is fixed with respect to the rigid body. Then we will study the coordinate transformations between this coordinate and the fixed \"laboratory\" system.\n\nAs shown in the figure on the right, the lab system's origin is at point O, the rigid body system origin is at O\u2032 and the vector from O to O\u2032 is R. A particle (i) in the rigid body is located at point P and the vector position of this particle is Ri in the lab frame, and at position ri in the body frame. It is seen that the position of the particle can be written:\n\n\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            R\n          \n          \n            i\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          R\n        \n        +\n        \n          \n            r\n          \n          \n            i\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {R} _{i}=\\mathbf {R} +\\mathbf {r} _{i}}\n  \n\n\n\nThe defining characteristic of a rigid body is that the distance between any two points in a rigid body is unchanging in time. This means that the length of the vector \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            r\n          \n          \n            i\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {r} _{i}}\n  \n is unchanging. By Euler's rotation theorem, we may replace the vector \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            r\n          \n          \n            i\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {r} _{i}}\n  \n with \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            R\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            r\n          \n          \n            i\n            o\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {R}}\\mathbf {r} _{io}}\n  \n where \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            R\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {R}}}\n  \n is a 3\u00d73 rotation matrix and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            r\n          \n          \n            i\n            o\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {r} _{io}}\n  \n is the position of the particle at some fixed point in time, say t = 0.

Also, since the three columns of the rotation matrix represent the three versors of a reference frame rotating together with the rigid body, any rotation about any axis becomes now visible, while the vector \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            r\n          \n          \n            i\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {r} _{i}}\n  \n would not rotate if the rotation axis were parallel to it, and hence it would only describe a rotation about an axis perpendicular to it (i.e., it would not see the component of the angular velocity pseudovector parallel to it, and would only allow the computation of the component perpendicular to it).

This is because the velocity of the instantaneous axis of rotation is zero. An example of the instantaneous axis of rotation is the hinge of a door. Another example is the point of contact of a purely rolling spherical (or, more generally, convex) rigid body.\n\n\nSee also[edit]\n\n\tAngular acceleration\n\tAngular frequency\n\tAngular momentum\n\tAreal velocity\n\tIsometry\n\tOrthogonal group\n\tRigid body dynamics\n\tVorticity\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n\t^ Hibbeler, Russell C.

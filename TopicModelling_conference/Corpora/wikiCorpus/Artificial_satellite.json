These objects are called artificial satellites to distinguish them from natural satellites such as Earth's Moon.\n\nOn 4 October 1957 the Soviet Union launched the world's first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1. Since then, about 8,900 satellites from more than 40 countries have been launched. According to a 2018 estimate, some 5,000 remain in orbit. Of those about 1,900 were operational, while the rest have lived out their useful lives and become space debris. Approximately 63% of operational satellites are in low-Earth orbit, 6% are in medium-Earth orbit (at 20,000\u00a0km), 29% are in geostationary orbit (at 36,000\u00a0km) and the remaining 2% are in elliptic orbit.[1]\nA few large space stations have been launched in parts and assembled in orbit. Over a dozen space probes have been placed into orbit around other bodies and become artificial satellites of the Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, a few asteroids,[2] a comet and the Sun. \n\nSatellites are used for many purposes. Among several other applications, they can be used to make star maps and maps of planetary surfaces, and also take pictures of planets they are launched into. Common types include military and civilian Earth observation satellites, communications satellites, navigation satellites, weather satellites, and space telescopes. Space stations and human spacecraft in orbit are also satellites. Satellite orbits vary greatly, depending on the purpose of the satellite, and are classified in a number of ways. Well-known (overlapping) classes include low Earth orbit, polar orbit, and geostationary orbit.\n\nA launch vehicle is a rocket that places a satellite into orbit. Usually, it lifts off from a launch pad on land. Some are launched at sea from a submarine or a mobile maritime platform, or aboard a plane (see air launch to orbit).\n\nSatellites are usually semi-independent computer-controlled systems. Satellite subsystems attend many tasks, such as power generation, thermal control, telemetry, attitude \n\n\nContents\n\n\n\t1 History\n\t2 Space Surveillance Network\n\t3 Non-military satellite services\n\t3.1 Fixed satellite services\n\t3.2 Mobile satellite systems\n\t3.3 Scientific research satellites (commercial and noncommercial)\n\n\n\n\t4 Types\n\t5 Orbit types\n\t5.1 Centric classifications\n\t5.2 Altitude classifications\n\t5.3 Inclination classifications\n\t5.4 Eccentricity classifications\n\t5.5 Synchronous classifications\n\t5.6 Special classifications\n\t5.7 Pseudo-orbit classifications\n\n\n\n\t6 Satellite subsystems\n\t6.1 Spacecraft bus or service module\n\t6.1.1 Structural subsystem\n\t6.1.2 Telemetry subsystem\n\t6.1.3 Power subsystem\n\t6.1.4 Thermal control subsystem\n\t6.1.5 Attitude and orbit control subsystem\n\n\n\n\t6.2 Communication payload\n\n\n\n\t7 End of life\n\t8 Launch-capable countries\n\t8.1 Attempted first launches\n\t8.2 Other notes\n\t8.3 Launch capable private entities\n\n\n\n\t9 First satellites of countries\n\t9.1 Attempted first satellites\n\t9.2 Planned first satellites\n\n\n\n\t10 Attacks on satellites\n\t10.1 Jamming\n\n\n\n\t11 Earth observation using satellites\n\t11.1 NASA\n\t11.2 ESA\n\t11.3 SpaceX\n\t11.4 Amazon and Lockheed\n\n\n\n\t12 Satellite services\n\t13 See also\n\t14 References\n\t15 External links\n\n\n\n\n\nHistory[edit]\n\n  \nKonstantin Tsiolkovsky\n\n\n\n  \nA 1949 issue of Popular Science depicts the idea of an \"artificial moon\"\n\n\n\n  \nAnimation depicting the orbits of GPS satellites in medium Earth orbit.\n\n\n\n  \nSputnik 1: The first artificial satellite to orbit Earth.\n\n\n\n  \n1U CubeSat ESTCube-1, developed mainly by the students from the University of Tartu, carries out a tether deployment experiment in low Earth orbit.\n\n\n\nThe first published mathematical study of the possibility of an artificial satellite was Newton's cannonball, a thought experiment in A Treatise of the System of the World by Isaac Newton (1687). The first fictional depiction of a satellite being launched into orbit was a short story by Edward Everett Hale, The Brick Moon.[3][4] The idea surfaced again in Jules Verne's The Begum's Fortune (1879).\n\nIn 1903, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky (1857\u20131935) published Exploring Space Using Jet Propulsion Devices, which is the first academic treatise on the use of rocketry to launch spacecraft. He calculated the orbital speed required for a minimal orbit, and that a multi-stage rocket fueled by liquid propellants could achieve this.\n\nIn 1928, Herman Poto\u010dnik (1892\u20131929) published his sole book, The Problem of Space Travel \u2013 The Rocket Motor. He described the use of orbiting spacecraft for observation of the ground and described how the special conditions of space could be useful for scientific experiments.\n\nIn a 1945 Wireless World article, the English science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke described in detail the possible use of communications satellites for mass communications.[5] He suggested that three geostationary satellites would provide coverage over the entire planet.\n\nIn May 1946, the United States Air Force's Project RAND released the Preliminary Design of an Experimental World-Circling Spaceship, which stated that \"A satellite vehicle with appropriate instrumentation can be expected to be one of the most potent scientific tools of the Twentieth Century.\"[6] The United States had been considering launching orbital satellites since 1945 under the Bureau of Aeronautics of the United States Navy. Project RAND eventually released the report, but considered the satellite to be a tool for science, politics, and propaganda, rather than a potential military weapon.[7] In February 1954 Project RAND released \"Scientific Uses for a Satellite Vehicle,\" written by R.R. Carhart.[8] This expanded on potential scientific uses for satellite vehicles and was followed in June 1955 with \"The Scientific Use of an Artificial Satellite,\" by H.K. Kallmann and W.W. Kellogg.[9]\n\nIn the context of activities planned for the International Geophysical Year (1957\u201358), the White House announced on 29 July 1955 that the U.S. intended to launch satellites by the spring of 1958. This became known as Project Vanguard. On 31 July, the Soviets announced that they intended to launch a satellite by the fall of 1957.\n\nThe first artificial satellite was Sputnik 1, launched by the Soviet Union on 4 October 1957 under the Sputnik program, with Sergei Korolev as chief designer. Sputnik 1 helped to identify the density of high atmospheric layers through measurement of its orbital change and provided data on radio-signal distribution in the ionosphere. The unanticipated announcement of Sputnik 1's success precipitated the Sputnik crisis in the United States and ignited the so-called Space Race within the Cold War.\n\nSputnik 2 was launched on 3 November 1957 and carried the first living passenger into orbit, a dog named Laika.[10]\n\nIn early 1955, following pressure by the American Rocket Society, the National Science Foundation, and the International Geophysical Year, the Army and Navy were working on Project Orbiter with two competing programs. The army used the Jupiter C rocket, while the civilian/Navy program used the Vanguard rocket to launch a satellite. Explorer 1 became the United States' first artificial satellite on 31 January 1958.[11]\n\nIn June 1961, three-and-a-half years after the launch of Sputnik 1, the United States Space Surveillance Network cataloged 115 Earth-orbiting satellites.[12]\n\nEarly satellites were constructed to unique designs. With advancements in technology, multiple satellites began to be built on single model platforms called satellite buses. The first standardized satellite bus design was the HS-333 geosynchronous (GEO) communication satellite launched in 1972.\n\nCurrently the largest artificial satellite ever is the International Space Station.\n\n\nSpace Surveillance Network[edit]\n\nMain article: United States Space Surveillance Network\n\nThe United States Space Surveillance Network (SSN), a division of the United States Strategic Command, has been tracking objects in Earth's orbit since 1957 when the Soviet Union opened the Space Age with the launch of Sputnik I. Since then, the SSN has tracked more than 26,000 objects. The SSN currently tracks more than 8,000-artificial orbiting objects. The rest have re-entered Earth's atmosphere and disintegrated, or survived re-entry and impacted the Earth. The SSN tracks objects that are 10 centimeters in diameter or larger; those now orbiting Earth range from satellites weighing several tons to pieces of spent rocket bodies weighing only 10 pounds. About seven percent are operational satellites (i.e. ~560 satellites), the rest are space debris.[13] The United States Strategic Command is primarily interested in the active satellites, but also tracks space debris which upon reentry might otherwise be mistaken for incoming missiles.\n\n\nNon-military satellite services[edit]\n\nThere are three basic categories of non-military satellite services:[14]\n\n\nFixed satellite services[edit]\n\nFixed satellite services handle hundreds of billions of voice, data, and video transmission tasks across all countries and continents between certain points on the Earth's surface.\n\n\nMobile satellite systems[edit]\n\nMain article: Mobile-satellite service\n\nMobile satellite systems help connect remote regions, vehicles, ships, people and aircraft to other parts of the world and/or other mobile or stationary communications units, in addition to serving as navigation systems.\n\n\n Scientific research satellites (commercial and noncommercial)[edit]\n\nScientific research satellites provide meteorological information, land survey data (e.g. remote sensing), Amateur (HAM) Radio, and other different scientific research applications such as earth science, marine science, and atmospheric research.\n\n\nTypes[edit]\n\n\tAstronomical satellites are satellites used for observation of distant planets, galaxies, and other outer space objects.\n\tBiosatellites are satellites designed to carry living organisms, generally for scientific experimentation.\n\tCommunication satellites are satellites stationed in space for the purpose of telecommunications. Modern communications satellites typically use geosynchronous orbits, Molniya orbits or Low Earth orbits.\n\tEarth observation satellites are satellites intended for non-military uses such as environmental monitoring, meteorology, map making etc. (See especially Earth Observing System.)\n\tNavigational satellites are satellites which use radio time signals transmitted to enable mobile receivers on the ground to determine their exact location. The relatively clear line of sight between the satellites and receivers on the ground, combined with ever-improving electronics, allows satellite navigation systems to measure location to accuracies on the order of a few meters in real time.\n\tKiller Satellites are satellites that are designed to destroy enemy warheads, satellites, and other space assets.\n\tCrewed spacecraft (spaceships) are large satellites able to put humans into (and beyond) an orbit, and return them to Earth. Spacecraft including spaceplanes of reusable systems have major propulsion or landing facilities. They can be used as transport to and from the orbital stations.\n\tMiniaturized satellites are satellites of unusually low masses and small sizes.[15] New classifications are used to categorize these satellites: minisatellite (500\u20131000\u00a0kg), microsatellite (below 100\u00a0kg), nanosatellite (below 10\u00a0kg).[citation needed]\n\tReconnaissance satellites are Earth observation satellite or communications satellite deployed for military or intelligence applications. Very little is known about the full power of these satellites, as governments who operate them usually keep information pertaining to their reconnaissance satellites classified.\n\tRecovery satellites are satellites that provide a recovery of reconnaissance, biological, space-production and other payloads from orbit to Earth.\n\n\n  \nInternational Space Station\n\n\n\n\tSpace-based solar power satellites are proposed satellites that would collect energy from sunlight and transmit it for use on Earth or other places.\n\tSpace stations are artificial orbital structures that are designed for human beings to live on in outer space. A space station is distinguished from other crewed spacecraft by its lack of major propulsion or landing facilities. Space stations are designed for medium-term living in orbit, for periods of weeks, months, or even years.\n\tTether satellites are satellites which are connected to another satellite by a thin cable called a tether.\n\tWeather satellites are primarily used to monitor Earth's weather and climate.[16]\n\n\nOrbit types[edit]\n\nMain article: List of orbits\n\n  \nVarious earth orbits to scale; cyan represents low earth orbit, yellow represents medium earth orbit, the black dashed line represents geosynchronous orbit, the green dash-dot line the orbit of Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites, and the red dotted line the orbit of the International Space Station (ISS).\n\n\n\nThe first satellite, Sputnik 1, was put into orbit around Earth and was therefore in geocentric orbit. By far this is the most common type of orbit with approximately 1,886[17] artificial satellites orbiting the Earth. Geocentric orbits may be further classified by their altitude, inclination and eccentricity.\n\nThe commonly used altitude classifications of geocentric orbit are Low Earth orbit (LEO), Medium Earth orbit (MEO) and High Earth orbit (HEO). Low Earth orbit is any orbit below 2,000 km. Medium Earth orbit is any orbit between 2,000 and 35,786\u00a0km. High Earth orbit is any orbit higher than 35,786\u00a0km.\n\n\nCentric classifications[edit]\n\n\tGalactocentric orbit: An orbit around the centre of a galaxy. The Sun follows this type of orbit about the galactic centre of the Milky Way.\n\tGeocentric orbit: An orbit around the planet Earth, such as the Moon or artificial satellites. Currently there are approximately 1,886[17] artificial satellites orbiting the Earth.\n\tHeliocentric orbit: An orbit around the Sun. In our Solar System, all planets, comets, and asteroids are in such orbits, as are many artificial satellites and pieces of space debris. Moons by contrast are not in a heliocentric orbit but rather orbit their parent planet.\n\tAreocentric orbit: An orbit around the planet Mars, such as by moons or artificial satellites.\n\n\nThe general structure of a satellite is that it is connected to the earth stations that are present on the ground and connected through terrestrial links.\n\n\nAltitude classifications[edit]\n\n\tLow Earth orbit (LEO): Geocentric orbits ranging in altitude from 180\u00a0km \u2013 2,000\u00a0km (1,200\u00a0mi)\n\tMedium Earth orbit (MEO): Geocentric orbits ranging in altitude from 2,000\u00a0km (1,200\u00a0mi) \u2013 35,786\u00a0km (22,236\u00a0mi). Also known as an intermediate circular orbit.\n\tGeosynchronous orbit (GEO): Geocentric circular orbit with an altitude of 35,786 kilometres (22,236\u00a0mi). The period of the orbit equals one sidereal day, coinciding with the rotation period of the Earth. The speed is approximately 3,000 metres per second (9,800\u00a0ft/s).\n\tHigh Earth orbit (HEO): Geocentric orbits above the altitude of geosynchronous orbit 35,786\u00a0km (22,236\u00a0mi).\n\n\n  \nOrbital Altitudes of several significant satellites of earth.\n\n\n\nInclination classifications[edit]\n\n\tInclined orbit: An orbit whose inclination in reference to the equatorial plane is not zero degrees.\n\tPolar orbit: An orbit that passes above or nearly above both poles of the planet on each revolution. Therefore, it has an inclination of (or very close to) 90 degrees.\n\tPolar sun synchronous orbit: A nearly polar orbit that passes the equator at the same local time on every pass. Useful for image taking satellites because shadows will be nearly the same on every pass.\n\n\n\n\nEccentricity classifications[edit]\n\n\tCircular orbit: An orbit that has an eccentricity of 0 and whose path traces a circle.\n\tHohmann transfer orbit: An orbit that moves a spacecraft from one approximately circular orbit, usually the orbit of a planet, to another, using two engine impulses. The perihelion of the transfer orbit is at the same distance from the Sun as the radius of one planet's orbit, and the aphelion is at the other. The two rocket burns change the spacecraft's path from one circular orbit to the transfer orbit, and later to the other circular orbit. This maneuver was named after Walter Hohmann.\n\n\n\tElliptic orbit: An orbit with an eccentricity greater than 0 and less than 1 whose orbit traces the path of an ellipse.\n\tGeosynchronous transfer orbit: An elliptic orbit where the perigee is at the altitude of a Low Earth orbit (LEO) and the apogee at the altitude of a geosynchronous orbit.\n\tGeostationary transfer orbit: An elliptic orbit where the perigee is at the altitude of a Low Earth orbit (LEO) and the apogee at the altitude of a geostationary orbit.\n\tMolniya orbit: A highly elliptic orbit with inclination of 63.4\u00b0 and orbital period of half of a sidereal day (roughly 12 hours). Such a satellite spends most of its time over two designated areas of the planet (specifically Russia and the United States).\n\tTundra orbit: A highly elliptic orbit with inclination of 63.4\u00b0 and orbital period of one sidereal day (roughly 24 hours). Such a satellite spends most of its time over a single designated area of the planet.\n\n\n\n\nSynchronous classifications[edit]\n\n\tSynchronous orbit: An orbit where the satellite has an orbital period equal to the average rotational period (earth's is: 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4.091 seconds) of the body being orbited and in the same direction of rotation as that body. To a ground observer such a satellite would trace an analemma (figure 8) in the sky.\n\tSemi-synchronous orbit (SSO): An orbit with an altitude of approximately 20,200\u00a0km (12,600\u00a0mi) and an orbital period equal to one-half of the average rotational period (Earth's is approximately 12 hours) of the body being orbited\n\tGeosynchronous orbit (GSO): Orbits with an altitude of approximately 35,786\u00a0km (22,236\u00a0mi). Such a satellite would trace an analemma (figure 8) in the sky.\n\tGeostationary orbit (GEO): A geosynchronous orbit with an inclination of zero. To an observer on the ground this satellite would appear as a fixed point in the sky.[18]\n\tClarke orbit: Another name for a geostationary orbit. Named after scientist and writer Arthur C. Clarke.\n\n\n\tSupersynchronous orbit: A disposal / storage orbit above GSO/GEO. Satellites will drift west. Also a synonym for Disposal orbit.\n\tSubsynchronous orbit: A drift orbit close to but below GSO/GEO. Satellites will drift east.\n\tGraveyard orbit: An orbit a few hundred kilometers above geosynchronous that satellites are moved into at the end of their operation.\n\tDisposal orbit: A synonym for graveyard orbit.\n\tJunk orbit: A synonym for disposal orbit.\n\n\n\n\n\tAreosynchronous orbit: A synchronous orbit around the planet Mars with an orbital period equal in length to Mars' sidereal day, 24.6229 hours.\n\tAreostationary orbit (ASO): A circular areosynchronous orbit on the equatorial plane and about 17000\u00a0km (10557 miles) above the surface. To an observer on the ground this satellite would appear as a fixed point in the sky.\n\tHeliosynchronous orbit: A heliocentric orbit about the Sun where the satellite's orbital period matches the Sun's period of rotation. These orbits occur at a radius of 24,360 Gm (0.1628 AU) around the Sun, a little less than half of the orbital radius of Mercury.\n\n\nSpecial classifications[edit]\n\n\tSun-synchronous orbit: An orbit which combines altitude and inclination in such a way that the satellite passes over any given point of the planets' surface at the same local solar time. Such an orbit can place a satellite in constant sunlight and is useful for imaging, spy, and weather satellites.\n\tMoon orbit: The orbital characteristics of Earth's Moon. Average altitude of 384,403 kilometers (238,857\u00a0mi), elliptical\u2013inclined orbit.\n\n\nPseudo-orbit classifications[edit]\n\n\tHorseshoe orbit: An orbit that appears to a ground observer to be orbiting a certain planet but is actually in co-orbit with the planet. See asteroids 3753 (Cruithne) and 2002 AA29.\n\tSuborbital spaceflight: A maneuver where a spacecraft approaches the height of orbit but lacks the velocity to sustain it.\n\tLunar transfer orbit (LTO)\n\tPrograde orbit: An orbit with an inclination of less than 90\u00b0. Or rather, an orbit that is in the same direction as the rotation of the primary.\n\tRetrograde orbit: An orbit with an inclination of more than 90\u00b0. Or rather, an orbit counter to the direction of rotation of the planet. Apart from those in sun-synchronous orbit, few satellites are launched into retrograde orbit because the quantity of fuel required to launch them is much greater than for a prograde orbit. This is because when the rocket starts out on the ground, it already has an eastward component of velocity equal to the rotational velocity of the planet at its launch latitude.\n\tHalo orbit and Lissajous orbit: Orbits \"around\" Lagrangian points.\n\n\nSatellite subsystems[edit]\n\nThe satellite's functional versatility is imbedded within its technical components and its operations characteristics. Looking at the \"anatomy\" of a typical satellite, one discovers two modules.[14] Note that some novel architectural concepts such as Fractionated spacecraft somewhat upset this taxonomy.\n\n\nSpacecraft bus or service module[edit]\n\nThe bus module consists of the following subsystems:\n\n\nStructural subsystem[edit]\n\nThe structural subsystem provides the mechanical base structure with adequate stiffness to withstand stress and vibrations experienced during launch, maintain structural integrity and stability while on station in orbit, and shields the satellite from extreme temperature changes and micro-meteorite damage.\n\n\nTelemetry subsystem[edit]\n\nThe telemetry subsystem (aka Command and Data Handling, C&DH) monitors the on-board equipment operations, transmits equipment operation data to the earth control station, and receives the earth control station's commands to perform equipment operation adjustments.\n\n\nPower subsystem[edit]\n\nThe power subsystem consists of solar panels to convert solar energy into electrical power, regulation and distribution functions, and batteries that store power and supply the satellite when it passes into the Earth's shadow. Nuclear power sources (Radioisotope thermoelectric generator) have also been used in several successful satellite programs including the Nimbus program (1964\u20131978).[19]\n\n\nThermal control subsystem[edit]\n\nMain article: Spacecraft thermal control\n\nThe thermal control subsystem helps protect electronic equipment from extreme temperatures due to intense sunlight or the lack of sun exposure on different sides of the satellite's body (e.g. optical solar reflector)\n\n\nAttitude and orbit control subsystem[edit]\n\nMain articles: Attitude control and Spacecraft propulsion\n\nThe attitude and orbit control subsystem consists of sensors to measure vehicle orientation, control laws embedded in the flight software, and actuators (reaction wheels, thrusters). These apply the torques and forces needed to re-orient the vehicle to a desired attitude, keep the satellite in the correct orbital position, and keep antennas pointed in the right directions.\n\n\nCommunication payload[edit]\n\nThe second major module is the communication payload, which is made up of transponders. A transponder is capable of\u00a0:\n\n\n\tReceiving uplinked radio signals from earth satellite transmission stations (antennas).\n\tAmplifying received radio signals\n\tSorting the input signals and directing the output signals through input/output signal multiplexers to the proper downlink antennas for retransmission to earth satellite receiving stations (antennas).\n\n\nEnd of life[edit]\n\nWhen satellites reach the end of their mission (this normally occurs within 3 or 4 years after launch), satellite operators have the option of de-orbiting the satellite, leaving the satellite in its current orbit or moving the satellite to a graveyard orbit. Historically, due to budgetary constraints at the beginning of satellite missions, satellites were rarely designed to be de-orbited. One example of this practice is the satellite Vanguard 1. Launched in 1958, Vanguard 1, the 4th artificial satellite put in Geocentric orbit, was still in orbit as of March\u00a02015[update], as well as the upper stage of its launch rocket.[20][21]\n\nInstead of being de-orbited, most satellites are either left in their current orbit or moved to a graveyard orbit.[22] As of 2002, the FCC requires all geostationary satellites to commit to moving to a graveyard orbit at the end of their operational life prior to launch.[23] In cases of uncontrolled de-orbiting, the major variable is the solar flux, and the minor variables the components and form factors of the satellite itself, and the gravitational perturbations generated by the Sun and the Moon (as well as those exercised by large mountain ranges, whether above or below sea level). The nominal breakup altitude due to aerodynamic forces and temperatures is 78\u00a0km, with a range between 72 and 84\u00a0km. Solar panels, however, are destroyed before any other component at altitudes between 90 and 95\u00a0km.[24]\n\n\nLaunch-capable countries[edit]\n\nMain article: Timeline of first orbital launches by nationality\n\nThis list includes countries with an independent capability to place satellites in orbit, including production of the necessary launch vehicle. Note: many more countries have the capability to design and build satellites but are unable to launch them, instead relying on foreign launch services. This list does not consider those numerous countries, but only lists those capable of launching satellites indigenously, and the date this capability was first demonstrated.

(May 2012)\n\n\n\n\tThe United States tried in 1957 to launch the first satellite using its own launcher before successfully completing a launch in 1958.\n\tJapan tried four times in 1966\u20131969 to launch a satellite with its own launcher before successfully completing a launch in 1970.\n\tChina tried in 1969 to launch the first satellite using its own launcher before successfully completing a launch in 1970.\n\tIndia, after launching its first national satellite using a foreign launcher in 1975, tried in 1979 to launch the first satellite using its own launcher before succeeding in 1980.\n\tIraq have claimed an orbital launch of a warhead in 1989, but this claim was later disproved.[28]\n\tBrazil, after launching its first national satellite using a foreign launcher in 1985, tried to launch a satellite using its own VLS 1 launcher three times in 1997, 1999, and 2003, but all attempts were unsuccessful.\n\tNorth Korea claimed a launch of Kwangmy\u014fngs\u014fng-1 and Kwangmy\u014fngs\u014fng-2 satellites in 1998 and 2009, but U.S., Russian and other officials and weapons experts later reported that the rockets failed to send a satellite into orbit, if that was the goal. The United States, Japan and South Korea believe this was actually a ballistic missile test, which was a claim also made after North Korea's 1998 satellite launch, and later rejected.[29] The first (April 2012) launch of Kwangmy\u014fngs\u014fng-3 was unsuccessful, a fact publicly recognized by the DPRK. However, the December 2012 launch of the \"second version\" of Kwangmy\u014fngs\u014fng-3 was successful, putting the DPRK's first confirmed satellite into orbit.\n\tSouth Korea (Korea Aerospace Research Institute), after launching their first national satellite by foreign launcher in 1992, unsuccessfully tried to launch its own launcher, the KSLV (Naro)-1, (created with the assistance of Russia) in 2009 and 2010 until success was achieved in 2013 by Naro-3.\n\tThe First European multi-national state organization ELDO tried to make the orbital launches at Europa I and Europa II rockets in 1968\u20131970 and 1971 but stopped operation after failures.\n\n\nOther notes[edit]\n\n\t^  Russia and the Ukraine were parts of the Soviet Union and thus inherited their launch capability without the need to develop it indigenously. Through the Soviet Union they are also on the number one position in this list of accomplishments.\n\tFrance, the United Kingdom, and Ukraine launched their first satellites by own launchers from foreign spaceports.\n\tSome countries such as South Africa, Spain, Italy, Germany, Canada, Australia, Argentina, Egypt and private companies such as OTRAG, have developed their own launchers, but have not had a successful launch.\n\tOnly twelve, countries from the list below (USSR, USA, France, Japan, China, UK, India, Russia, Ukraine, Israel, Iran and North Korea) and one regional organization (the European Space Agency, ESA) have independently launched satellites on their own indigenously developed launch vehicles.\n\tSeveral other countries, including Brazil, Argentina, Pakistan, Romania, Taiwan, Indonesia, Australia, Malaysia, Turkey and Switzerland are at various stages of development of their own small-scale launcher capabilities.\n\n\nLaunch capable private entities[edit]\n\nOrbital Sciences Corporation launched a satellite into orbit on the Pegasus in 1990.

You can help by adding to it.  (January 2015)\n\n\n\nAttacks on satellites[edit]\n\nFurther information: Anti-satellite weapon\n\nSince the mid-2000's, satellites have been hacked by militant organizations to broadcast propaganda and to pilfer classified information from military communication networks.[86][87]\n\nFor testing purposes, satellites in low earth orbit have been destroyed by ballistic missiles launched from earth. Russia, the United States, China and India have demonstrated the ability to eliminate satellites.[88] In 2007 the Chinese military shot down an aging weather satellite,[88] followed by the US Navy shooting down a defunct spy satellite in February 2008.[89] On 27 March 2019 the India shot down a live test satellite at 300 km altitude in 3 minutes. India became the fourth country to having capability to destroy live satellite.[90][91]\n\n\nJamming[edit]\n\nSee also: Radio jamming\n\nDue to the low received signal strength of satellite transmissions, they are prone to jamming by land-based transmitters. Such jamming is limited to the geographical area within the transmitter's range. GPS satellites are potential targets for jamming,[92][93] but satellite phone and television signals have also been subjected to jamming.[94][95]\n\nAlso, it is very easy to transmit a carrier radio signal to a geostationary satellite and thus interfere with the legitimate uses of the satellite's transponder. It is common for Earth stations to transmit at the wrong time or on the wrong frequency in commercial satellite space, and dual-illuminate the transponder, rendering the frequency unusable. Satellite operators now have sophisticated monitoring that enables them to pinpoint the source of any carrier and manage the transponder space effectively.[citation needed]\n\n\nEarth observation using satellites[edit]\n\nDuring the last five decades, space agencies have sent thousands of space crafts, space capsules, or satellites to the universe. In fact, weather forecasters make predictions on the weather and natural calamities based on observations from these satellites.[96]\n\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)[97] requested the National Academies to publish a report entitled, Earth Observations from Space; The First 50 Years of Scientific Achievements in 2008. It described how the capability to view the whole globe simultaneously from satellite observations revolutionized studies about the planet Earth. This development brought about a new age of combined Earth sciences. The National Academies report concluded that continuing Earth observations from the galaxy are necessary to resolve scientific and social challenges in the future.[98]\n\n\nNASA[edit]\n\nSee also: Earth Observing System\n\nThe NASA introduced an Earth Observing System (EOS)[99] composed of several satellites, science component, and data system described as the Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS). It disseminates numerous science data products as well as services designed for interdisciplinary education. EOSDIS data can be accessed online and accessed through File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS).[100] Scientists and researchers perform EOSDIS science operations within a distributed platform of multiple interconnected nodes or Science Investigator-led Processing Systems (SIPS) and discipline-specific Distributed Active Archive Centers (DACCs).[101]\n\n\nESA[edit]\n\nThe European Space Agency[102] have been operating Earth Observation satellites since the launch of Meteosat 1 in November 1977[103]. ESA currently has plans to launch a satellite equipped with an artificial intelligence (AI) processor that will allow the spacecraft to make decisions on images to capture and data to transmit to the Earth.[104] BrainSat will use the Intel Myriad X vision processing unit (VPU). The launching will be scheduled in 2019. ESA director for Earth Observation Programs Josef Aschbacher made the announcement during the PhiWeek in November 2018.[105] This is the five-day meet that focused on the future of Earth observation. The conference was held at the ESA Center for Earth Observation in Frascati, Italy.[104] ESA also launched the PhiLab, referring to the future-focused team that works to harness the potentials of AI and other disruptive innovations.[106] Meanwhile, the ESA also announced that it expects to commence the qualification flight of the Space Rider space plane in 2021. This will come after several demonstration missions.[107] Space Rider is the sequel of the Agency's Intermediate Experimental vehicle (IXV) which was launched in 2015. It has the capacity payload of 800 kilograms for orbital missions that will last a maximum of two months.[108]\n\n\nSpaceX[edit]\n\nSpaceX was scheduled to launch a multiple satellite mission on 28 November 2018 from the United States Vandenberg Air Force Base after an initial 19 November schedule. The launch is expected to be visible once the rocket heads toward the south into an Earth observation trajectory traveling over the opposites.[109] However, the second supposed launched was delayed again because of poor weather conditions and the actual launch occurred on December 3, 2018.[110] The mission is known as the SSO-A Smallsat Express was executed by Spaceflight, a rideshare and mission management provider based in Seattle, Wash. [111] The launch was a landmark for Elon Musk, founder of SpaceX which had 19 rocket launches in 2018 alone. The estimated cost of this Falcon 9 rocket is approximately $62\u00a0million. The rocket has 64 satellites with each one going separate ways.[112]\n\n\nAmazon and Lockheed[edit]\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS)[113] and Lockheed Martin[114] entered into a strategic partnership for the purpose of integrating the AWS ground station service with Lockheed's verge antenna network. These two corporations aim to merge these highly-capable systems that will provide clients with robust satellite uplinks and downlinks. Through these systems, users can incorporate satellite data with various AWS services which include computing, storage, analytics, and machine-learning.[115]\n\n\nSatellite services[edit]\n\n\n\tSatellite crop monitoring\n\tSatellite Internet access\n\tSatellite navigation\n\tSatellite phone\n\tSatellite radio\n\tSatellite television\n\n\n\n\nSee also[edit]\n\n\n\tSpaceflight portal\n\n\n\n\n\t2009 satellite collision\n\tArtificial satellites in retrograde orbit\n\tAtmospheric satellite\n\tFractionated spacecraft\n\tImagery intelligence\n\tInternational Designator\n\tList of communications satellite firsts\n\tList of Earth observation satellites\n\tList of passive satellites\n\tSatellite Catalog Number\n\tSatellite formation flying\n\tSatellite geolocation\n\tSatellite watching\n\tSpace exploration\n\tSpace probe\n\tSpaceport (including list of spaceports)\n\tSatellites on stamps\n\tUSA-193 (2008 American anti-satellite missile test)\n\n\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n\t^ \"How many satellites are orbiting earth in 2018\".

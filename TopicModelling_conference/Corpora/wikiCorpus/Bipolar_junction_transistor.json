This ability gives them many applications in electronic equipment such as computers, televisions, mobile phones, audio amplifiers, industrial control, and radio transmitters.\n\n\nCurrent direction conventions[edit]\n\nBy convention, the direction of current on diagrams is shown as the direction that a positive charge would move.  This is called conventional current.  However, current in many metal conductors is due to the flow of electrons. Because electrons carry a negative charge, they move in the direction opposite to conventional current.[a] On the other hand, inside a bipolar transistor, currents can be composed of both positively charged holes and negatively charged electrons.  In this article, current arrows are shown in the conventional direction, but labels for the movement of holes and electrons show their actual direction inside the transistor.  The arrow on the symbol for bipolar transistors indicates the PN junction between base and emitter and points in the direction in which conventional current travels.\n\n\nFunction[edit]\n\n\t\n\tThis section may be too technical for most readers to understand.

(July 2012) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\n\n\n\nBJTs are available in two types, or polarities, known as PNP and NPN based on the doping types of the three main terminal regions.  An NPN transistor comprises two semiconductor junctions that share a thin p-doped region, and a PNP transistor comprises two semiconductor junctions that share a thin n-doped region.\n\n\n  \nNPN BJT with forward-biased E\u2013B junction and reverse-biased B\u2013C junction\n\n\n\n\nCharge flow in a BJT is due to diffusion of charge carriers across a junction between two regions of different charge concentrations. The regions of a BJT are called emitter, base, and collector.[b] A discrete transistor has three leads for connection to these regions. Typically, the emitter region is heavily doped compared to the other two layers, and the collector is doped much lighter than the base (collector doping is typically ten times lighter than base doping [2]). By design, most of the BJT collector current is due to the flow of charge carriers (electrons or holes) injected from a heavily doped emitter into the base where they are minority carriers that diffuse toward the collector, and so BJTs are classified as minority-carrier devices.\n\nIn typical operation, the base\u2013emitter junction is forward-biased, which means that the p-doped side of the junction is at a more positive potential than the n-doped side, and the base\u2013collector junction is reverse-biased. When forward bias is applied to the base\u2013emitter junction, the equilibrium between the thermally generated carriers and the repelling electric field of the n-doped emitter depletion region is disturbed. This allows thermally excited electrons to inject from the emitter into the base region. These electrons diffuse through the base from the region of high concentration near the emitter toward the region of low concentration near the collector. The electrons in the base are called minority carriers because the base is doped p-type, which makes holes the majority carrier in the base.\n\nTo minimize the fraction of carriers that recombine before reaching the collector\u2013base junction, the transistor's base region must be thin enough that carriers can diffuse across it in much less time than the semiconductor's minority-carrier lifetime. Having a lightly doped base ensures recombination rates are low. In particular, the thickness of the base must be much less than the diffusion length of the electrons. The collector\u2013base junction is reverse-biased, and so negligible electron injection occurs from the collector to the base, but carriers that are injected into the base and diffuse to reach the collector-base depletion region are swept into the collector by the electric field in the depletion region. The thin shared base and asymmetric collector\u2013emitter doping are what differentiates a bipolar transistor from two separate and oppositely biased diodes connected in series.\n\n\nVoltage, current, and charge control[edit]\n\nThe collector\u2013emitter current can be viewed as being controlled by the base\u2013emitter current (current control), or by the base\u2013emitter voltage (voltage control). These views are related by the current\u2013voltage relation of the base\u2013emitter junction, which is the usual exponential current\u2013voltage curve of a p\u2013n junction (diode).[3]\n\nThe explanation for collector current is the concentration gradient of minority carriers in the base region.[3][4][5] Due to low-level injection (in which there are much fewer excess carriers than normal majority carriers) the ambipolar transport rates (in which the excess majority and minority carriers flow at the same rate) is in effect determined by the excess minority carriers.\n\nDetailed transistor models of transistor action, such as the Gummel\u2013Poon model, account for the distribution of this charge explicitly to explain transistor behaviour more exactly.[6] The charge-control view easily handles phototransistors, where minority carriers in the base region are created by the absorption of photons, and handles the dynamics of turn-off, or recovery time, which depends on charge in the base region recombining. However, because base charge is not a signal that is visible at the terminals, the current- and voltage-control views are generally used in circuit design and analysis.\n\nIn analog circuit design, the current-control view is sometimes used because it is approximately linear. That is, the collector current is approximately \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u03b2\n          \n            F\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\beta _{\\text{F}}}\n  \n times the base current. Some basic circuits can be designed by assuming that the base-emitter voltage is approximately constant and that collector current is \u03b2 times the base current. However, to accurately and reliably design production BJT circuits, the voltage-control (for example, Ebers\u2013Moll) model is required[3]. The voltage-control model requires an exponential function to be taken into account, but when it is linearized such that the transistor can be modeled as a transconductance, as in the Ebers\u2013Moll model, design for circuits such as differential amplifiers again becomes a mostly linear problem, so the voltage-control view is often preferred. For translinear circuits, in which the exponential I\u2013V curve is key to the operation, the transistors are usually modeled as voltage-controlled current sources whose transconductance is proportional to their collector current. In general, transistor-level circuit analysis is performed using SPICE or a comparable analog-circuit simulator, so mathematical model complexity is usually not of much concern to the designer, but a simplified view of the characteristics allows designs to be created following a logical process.\n\n\nTurn-on, turn-off, and storage delay[edit]\n\nMain article: Baker clamp\n\nBipolar transistors, and particularly power transistors, have long base-storage times when they are driven into saturation; the base storage limits turn-off time in switching applications. A Baker clamp can prevent the transistor from heavily saturating, which reduces the amount of charge stored in the base and thus improves switching time.\n\n\nTransistor characteristics: alpha (\u03b1) and beta (\u03b2) [edit]\n\nThe proportion of carriers able to cross the base and reach the collector is a measure of the BJT efficiency. The heavy doping of the emitter region and light doping of the base region causes many more electrons to be injected from the emitter into the base than holes to be injected from the base into the emitter. A thin and lightly-doped base region means that most of the minority carriers that are injected into the base will diffuse to the collector and not recombine.\n\nThe common-emitter current gain is represented by \u03b2F or the h-parameter hFE; it is approximately the ratio of the DC collector current to the DC base current in forward-active region. It is typically greater than 50 for small-signal transistors, but can be smaller in transistors designed for high-power applications. Both injection efficiency and recombination in the base reduce the BJT gain.\n\nAnother useful characteristic is the common-base current gain, \u03b1F. The common-base current gain is approximately the gain of current from emitter to collector in the forward-active region. This ratio usually has a value close to unity; between 0.980 and 0.998. It is less than unity due to recombination of charge carriers as they cross the base region.\n\nAlpha and beta are related by the following identities:\n\n\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  \u03b1\n                  \n                    F\n                  \n                \n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \n                  \n                    \n                      I\n                      \n                        C\n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      I\n                      \n                        E\n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n                ,\n              \n              \n                \n                  \u03b2\n                  \n                    F\n                  \n                \n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \n                  \n                    \n                      I\n                      \n                        C\n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      I\n                      \n                        B\n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n                ,\n              \n            \n            \n              \n                \n                  \u03b1\n                  \n                    F\n                  \n                \n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \u03b2\n                      \n                        F\n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      1\n                      +\n                      \n                        \u03b2\n                        \n                          F\n                        \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n              \n                \n                \u27fa\n                \n                \n                  \u03b2\n                  \n                    F\n                  \n                \n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \n                  \n                    \n                      \u03b1\n                      \n                        F\n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      1\n                      \u2212\n                      \n                        \u03b1\n                        \n                          F\n                        \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n                .\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}\\alpha _{\\text{F}}&={\\frac {I_{\\text{C}}}{I_{\\text{E}}}},&\\beta _{\\text{F}}&={\\frac {I_{\\text{C}}}{I_{\\text{B}}}},\\\\\\alpha _{\\text{F}}&={\\frac {\\beta _{\\text{F}}}{1+\\beta _{\\text{F}}}}&\\iff \\beta _{\\text{F}}&={\\frac {\\alpha _{\\text{F}}}{1-\\alpha _{\\text{F}}}}.\\end{aligned}}}\n  \n\n\n\nBeta is a convenient figure of merit to describe the performance of a bipolar transistor, but is not a fundamental physical property of the device. Bipolar transistors can be considered voltage-controlled devices (fundamentally the collector current is controlled by the base-emitter voltage; the base current could be considered a defect and is controlled by the characteristics of the base-emitter junction and recombination in the base). In many designs beta is assumed high enough so that base current has a negligible effect on the circuit. In some circuits (generally switching circuits), sufficient base current is supplied so that even the lowest beta value a particular device may have will still allow the required collector current to flow.\n\n\nStructure[edit]\n\n  Simplified cross section of a planar NPN bipolar junction transistor\n\n\n\nA BJT consists of three differently doped semiconductor regions: the emitter region, the base region and the collector region. These regions are, respectively, p type, n type and p type in a PNP transistor, and n type, p type and n type in an NPN transistor. Each semiconductor region is connected to a terminal, appropriately labeled: emitter (E), base (B) and collector (C).\n\nThe base is physically located between the emitter and the collector and is made from lightly doped, high-resistivity material. The collector surrounds the emitter region, making it almost impossible for the electrons injected into the base region to escape without being collected, thus making the resulting value of \u03b1 very close to unity, and so, giving the transistor a large \u03b2. A cross-section view of a BJT indicates that the collector\u2013base junction has a much larger area than the emitter\u2013base junction.\n\nThe bipolar junction transistor, unlike other transistors, is usually not a symmetrical device. This means that interchanging the collector and the emitter makes the transistor leave the forward active mode and start to operate in reverse mode. Because the transistor's internal structure is usually optimized for forward-mode operation, interchanging the collector and the emitter makes the values of \u03b1 and \u03b2 in reverse operation much smaller than those in forward operation; often the \u03b1 of the reverse mode is lower than 0.5. The lack of symmetry is primarily due to the doping ratios of the emitter and the collector. The emitter is heavily doped, while the collector is lightly doped, allowing a large reverse bias voltage to be applied before the collector\u2013base junction breaks down. The collector\u2013base junction is reverse biased in normal operation. The reason the emitter is heavily doped is to increase the emitter injection efficiency: the ratio of carriers injected by the emitter to those injected by the base. For high current gain, most of the carriers injected into the emitter\u2013base junction must come from the emitter.\n\n\n  \nDie of a KSY34 high-frequency NPN transistor. Bond wires connect to the base and emitter\n\n\n\nThe low-performance \"lateral\" bipolar transistors sometimes used in CMOS processes are sometimes designed symmetrically, that is, with no difference between forward and backward operation.\n\nSmall changes in the voltage applied across the base\u2013emitter terminals cause the current between the emitter and the collector to change significantly. This effect can be used to amplify the input voltage or current. BJTs can be thought of as voltage-controlled current sources, but are more simply characterized as current-controlled current sources, or current amplifiers, due to the low impedance at the base.\n\nEarly transistors were made from germanium but most modern BJTs are made from silicon. A significant minority are also now made from gallium arsenide, especially for very high speed applications (see HBT, below).\n\n\nNPN[edit]\n\n  \nThe symbol of an NPN BJT. A mnemonic for the symbol is \"not pointing in\".\n\n\n\nNPN is one of the two types of bipolar transistors, consisting of a layer of P-doped semiconductor (the \"base\") between two N-doped layers. A small current entering the base is amplified to produce a large collector and emitter current. That is, when there is a positive potential difference measured from the base of an NPN transistor to its emitter (that is, when the base is high relative to the emitter), as well as a positive potential difference measured from the collector to the emitter, the transistor becomes active. In this \"on\" state, current flows from the collector to the emitter of the transistor. Most of the current is carried by electrons moving from emitter to collector as minority carriers in the P-type base region. To allow for greater current and faster operation, most bipolar transistors used today are NPN because electron mobility is higher than hole mobility.\n\n\nPNP[edit]\n\n  \nThe symbol of a PNP BJT. A mnemonic for the symbol is \"points in proudly\".\n\n\n\nThe other type of BJT is the PNP, consisting of a layer of N-doped semiconductor between two layers of P-doped material. A small current leaving the base is amplified in the collector output. That is, a PNP transistor is \"on\" when its base is pulled low relative to the emitter.\nIn a PNP transistor, the emitter\u2013base region is forward biased, so holes are injected into the base as minority carriers. The base is very thin, and most of the holes cross the reverse-biased base\u2013collector junction to the collector.\n\nThe arrows in the NPN and PNP transistor symbols indicate the PN junction between the base and emitter. When the device is in forward active or forward saturated mode, the arrow, placed on the emitter leg, points in the direction of the conventional current.\n\n\nHeterojunction bipolar transistor[edit]\n\n  \nBands in graded heterojunction NPN bipolar transistor. Barriers indicated for electrons to move from emitter to base and for holes to be injected backward from base to emitter; also, grading of bandgap in base assists electron transport in base region. Light colors indicate depleted regions.\n\n\n\nThe heterojunction bipolar transistor (HBT) is an improvement of the BJT that can handle signals of very high frequencies up to several hundred GHz. It is common in modern ultrafast circuits, mostly RF systems.[7][8]\n\n\n  \nSymbol for NPN bipolar transistor with current flow direction\n\n\n\nHeterojunction transistors have different semiconductors for the elements of the transistor. Usually the emitter is composed of a larger bandgap material than the base. The figure shows that this difference in bandgap allows the barrier for holes to inject backward from the base into the emitter, denoted in the figure as \u0394\u03c6p, to be made large, while the barrier for electrons to inject into the base \u0394\u03c6n is made low. This barrier arrangement helps reduce minority carrier injection from the base when the emitter-base junction is under forward bias, and thus reduces base current and increases emitter injection efficiency.\n\nThe improved injection of carriers into the base allows the base to have a higher doping level, resulting in lower resistance to access the base electrode. In the more traditional BJT, also referred to as homojunction BJT, the efficiency of carrier injection from the emitter to the base is primarily determined by the doping ratio between the emitter and base, which means the base must be lightly doped to obtain high injection efficiency, making its resistance relatively high. In addition, higher doping in the base can improve figures of merit like the Early voltage by lessening base narrowing.\n\nThe grading of composition in the base, for example, by progressively increasing the amount of germanium in a SiGe transistor, causes a gradient in bandgap in the neutral base, denoted in the figure by \u0394\u03c6G, providing a \"built-in\" field that assists electron transport across the base. That drift component of transport aids the normal diffusive transport, increasing the frequency response of the transistor by shortening the transit time across the base.\n\nTwo commonly used HBTs are silicon\u2013germanium and aluminum gallium arsenide, though a wide variety of semiconductors may be used for the HBT structure. HBT structures are usually grown by epitaxy techniques like MOCVD and MBE.\n\n\nRegions of operation[edit]\n\n\tJunction \ntype\n\tApplied \nvoltages\n\tJunction bias\n\tMode\n\n\tB-E\n\tB-C\n\n\tNPN\n\tE < B < C\tForward\tReverse\tForward-active\n\n\tE < B > C\tForward\tForward\tSaturation\n\n\tE > B < C\tReverse\tReverse\tCut-off\n\n\tE > B > C\tReverse\tForward\tReverse-active\n\n\tPNP\n\tE < B < C\tReverse\tForward\tReverse-active\n\n\tE < B > C\tReverse\tReverse\tCut-off\n\n\tE > B < C\tForward\tForward\tSaturation\n\n\tE > B > C\tForward\tReverse\tForward-active\n\n\n\nBipolar transistors have four distinct regions of operation, defined by BJT junction biases.\n\n\n\tForward-active (or simply active)\n\tThe base\u2013emitter junction is forward biased and the base\u2013collector junction is reverse biased. Most bipolar transistors are designed to afford the greatest common-emitter current gain, \u03b2F, in forward-active mode. If this is the case, the collector\u2013emitter current is approximately  proportional to the base current, but many times larger, for small base current variations.\n\tReverse-active (or inverse-active or inverted)\n\tBy reversing the biasing conditions of the forward-active region, a bipolar transistor goes into reverse-active mode. In this mode, the emitter and collector regions switch roles. Because most BJTs are designed to maximize current gain in forward-active mode, the \u03b2F in inverted mode is several times smaller (2\u20133 times for the ordinary germanium transistor). This transistor mode is seldom used, usually being considered only for failsafe conditions and some types of bipolar logic. The reverse bias breakdown voltage to the base may be an order of magnitude lower in this region.\n\tSaturation\n\tWith both junctions forward-biased, a BJT is in saturation mode and facilitates high current conduction from the emitter to the collector (or the other direction in the case of NPN, with negatively charged carriers flowing from emitter to collector). This mode corresponds to a logical \"on\", or a closed switch.\n\tCut-off\n\tIn cut-off, biasing conditions opposite of saturation (both junctions reverse biased) are present. There is very little current, which corresponds to a logical \"off\", or an open switch.\n\tAvalanche breakdown region\n\t\n\n\n\nInput characteristics\n\n\noutput characteristics\n\n\nInput and output characteristics for a common-base silicon transistor amplifier.\n\n\n\n\nThe modes of operation can be described in terms of the applied voltages (this description applies to NPN transistors; polarities are reversed for PNP transistors):\n\n\n\tForward-active\n\tBase higher than emitter, collector higher than base (in this mode the collector current is proportional to base current by \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u03b2\n          \n            F\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\beta _{\\text{F}}}\n  \n).\n\tSaturation\n\tBase higher than emitter, but collector is not higher than base.\n\tCut-off\n\tBase lower than emitter, but collector is higher than base. It means the transistor is not letting conventional current go through from collector to emitter.\n\tReverse-active\n\tBase lower than emitter, collector lower than base: reverse conventional current goes through transistor.\n\n\nIn terms of junction biasing: (reverse biased base\u2013collector junction means Vbc < 0 for NPN, opposite for PNP)\n\nAlthough these regions are well defined for sufficiently large applied voltage, they overlap somewhat for small (less than a few hundred millivolts) biases. For example, in the typical grounded-emitter configuration of an NPN BJT used as a pulldown switch in digital logic, the \"off\" state never involves a reverse-biased junction because the base voltage never goes below ground; nevertheless the forward bias is close enough to zero that essentially no current flows, so this end of the forward active region can be regarded as the cutoff region.\n\n\nActive-mode transistors in circuits[edit]\n\n  Structure and use of NPN transistor. Arrow according to schematic.\n\n\n\nThe diagram shows a schematic representation of an NPN transistor connected to two voltage sources. (The same description applies to a PNP transistor with reversed directions of current flow and applied voltage.)  This applied voltage causes the lower P-N junction to become forward biased, allowing a flow of electrons from the emitter into the base. In active mode, the electric field existing between base and collector (caused by VCE) will cause the majority of these electrons to cross the upper P-N junction into the collector to form the collector current IC. The remainder of the electrons recombine with holes, the majority carriers in the base, making a current through the base connection to form the base current, IB. As shown in the diagram, the emitter current, IE, is the total transistor current, which is the sum of the other terminal currents, (i.e., IE\u00a0=\u00a0IB\u00a0+\u00a0IC).\n\nIn the diagram, the arrows representing current point in the direction of conventional current\u00a0\u2013 the flow of electrons is in the opposite direction of the arrows because electrons carry negative electric charge. In active mode, the ratio of the collector current to the base current is called the DC current gain. This gain is usually 100 or more, but robust circuit designs do not depend on the exact value (for example see op-amp). The value of this gain for DC signals is referred to as \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          h\n          \n            FE\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle h_{\\text{FE}}}\n  \n, and the value of this gain for small signals is referred to as \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          h\n          \n            fe\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle h_{\\text{fe}}}\n  \n.

Because the base current is approximately proportional to the collector and emitter currents, they vary in the same way.\n\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nThe bipolar point-contact transistor was invented in December 1947[10] at the Bell Telephone Laboratories by John Bardeen and Walter Brattain under the direction of William Shockley. The junction version known as the bipolar junction transistor (BJT), invented by Shockley in 1948,[11] was for three decades the device of choice in the design of discrete and integrated circuits. Nowadays, the use of the BJT has declined in favor of CMOS technology in the design of digital integrated circuits. The incidental low performance BJTs inherent in CMOS ICs, however, are often utilized as bandgap voltage reference, silicon bandgap temperature sensor and to handle electrostatic discharge.\n\n\nGermanium transistors[edit]\n\nThe germanium transistor was more common in the 1950s and 1960s but has a greater tendency to exhibit thermal runaway.\n\n\nEarly manufacturing techniques[edit]\n\nVarious methods of manufacturing bipolar transistors were developed.[12]\n\n\nBipolar transistors[edit]\n\n\tPoint-contact transistor\u00a0\u2013 first transistor ever constructed (December 1947), a bipolar transistor, limited commercial use due to high cost and noise.\n\tTetrode point-contact transistor \u2013 Point-contact transistor having two emitters.

A PNP BJT will function like two diodes that share an N-type cathode region, and the NPN like two diodes sharing a P-type anode region.  Connecting two diodes with wires will not make a transistor, since minority carriers will not be able to get from one P\u2013N junction to the other through the wire.\n\nBoth types of BJT function by letting a small current input to the base control an amplified output from the collector. The result is that the transistor makes a good switch that is controlled by its base input. The BJT also makes a good amplifier, since it can multiply a weak input signal to about 100 times its original strength. Networks of transistors are used to make powerful amplifiers with many different applications. In the discussion below, focus is on the NPN bipolar transistor. In the NPN transistor in what is called active mode, the base\u2013emitter voltage \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          V\n          \n            BE\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V_{\\text{BE}}}\n  \n and collector\u2013base voltage \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          V\n          \n            CB\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V_{\\text{CB}}}\n  \n are positive, forward biasing the emitter\u2013base junction and reverse-biasing the collector\u2013base junction. In the active mode of operation, electrons are injected from the forward biased n-type emitter region into the p-type base where they diffuse as minority carriers to the reverse-biased n-type collector and are swept away by the electric field in the reverse-biased collector\u2013base junction. For a figure describing forward and reverse bias, see semiconductor diodes.\n\n\nLarge-signal models[edit]\n\nIn 1954, Jewell James Ebers and John L. Moll introduced their mathematical model of transistor currents:[26]\n\n\nEbers\u2013Moll model[edit]\n\n  Ebers\u2013Moll model for an NPN transistor.[27] IB, IC and IE are the base, collector and emitter currents; ICD and IED are the collector and emitter diode currents; \u03b1F and \u03b1R are the forward and reverse common-base current gains.\n\n\n\n  Ebers\u2013Moll model for a PNP transistor\n\n\n\n  Approximated Ebers\u2013Moll model for an NPN transistor in the forward active mode. The collector diode is reverse-biased so ICD is virtually zero. Most of the emitter diode current (\u03b1F is nearly 1) is drawn from the collector, providing the amplification of the base current.\n\n\n\nThe DC emitter and collector currents in active mode are

An increase in the collector\u2013base voltage, for example, causes a greater reverse bias across the collector\u2013base junction, increasing the collector\u2013base depletion region width, and decreasing the width of the base. This variation in base width often is called the Early effect after its discoverer James M. Early.\n\nNarrowing of the base width has two consequences:\n\n\n\tThere is a lesser chance for recombination within the \"smaller\" base region.\n\tThe charge gradient is increased across the base, and consequently, the current of minority carriers injected across the emitter junction increases.\n\n\nBoth factors increase the collector or \"output\" current of the transistor in response to an increase in the collector\u2013base voltage.\n\nIn the forward-active region, the Early effect modifies the collector current (\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          i\n          \n            C\n

base\u2013emitter depletion region boundary. When in this state the transistor effectively has no base. The device thus loses all gain when in this state.\n\n\nGummel\u2013Poon charge-control model[edit]\n\nThe Gummel\u2013Poon model[29] is a detailed charge-controlled model of BJT dynamics, which has been adopted and elaborated by others to explain transistor dynamics in greater detail than the terminal-based models typically do.[30] This model also includes the dependence of transistor \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b2\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\beta }\n  \n-values upon the direct current levels in the transistor, which are assumed current-independent in the Ebers\u2013Moll model.[31]\n\n\nSmall-signal models[edit]\n\nHybrid-pi model[edit]\n\n  \nHybrid-pi model\n\n\n\nMain article: hybrid-pi model\n\nThe hybrid-pi model is a popular circuit model used for analyzing the small signal and AC behavior of bipolar junction and field effect transistors.

The model can be quite accurate for low-frequency circuits and can easily be adapted for higher-frequency circuits with the addition of appropriate inter-electrode capacitances and other parasitic elements.\n\n\n\n\nh-parameter model[edit]\n\n  Generalized h-parameter model of an NPN BJT.\nReplace x with e, b or c for CE, CB and CC topologies respectively.\n\n\n\nAnother model commonly used to analyze BJT circuits is the h-parameter model, closely related to the hybrid-pi model and the y-parameter two-port, but using input current and output voltage as independent variables, rather than input and output voltages. This two-port network is particularly suited to BJTs as it lends itself easily to the analysis of circuit behaviour, and may be used to develop further accurate models. As shown, the term, x, in the model represents a different BJT lead depending on the topology used. For common-emitter mode the various symbols take on the specific values as:\n\n\n\tTerminal 1, base\n\tTerminal 2, collector\n\tTerminal 3 (common), emitter; giving x to be e\n\tii, base current (ib)\n\tio, collector current (ic)\n\tVin, base-to-emitter voltage (VBE)\n\tVo, collector-to-emitter voltage (VCE)\n\n\nand the h-parameters are given by:\n\n\n\thix = hie, the input impedance of the transistor (corresponding to the base resistance rpi).\n\thrx = hre, represents the dependence of the transistor's IB\u2013VBE curve on the value of VCE. It is usually very small and is often neglected (assumed to be zero).\n\thfx = hfe, the current-gain of the transistor. This parameter is often specified as hFE or the DC current-gain (\u03b2DC) in datasheets.\n\thox = 1/hoe, the output impedance of transistor. The parameter hoe usually corresponds to the output admittance of the bipolar transistor and has to be inverted to convert it to an impedance.\n\n\nAs shown, the h-parameters have lower-case subscripts and hence signify AC conditions or analyses. For DC conditions they are specified in upper-case. For the CE topology, an approximate h-parameter model is commonly used which further simplifies the circuit analysis. For this the hoe and hre parameters are neglected (that is, they are set to infinity and zero, respectively). The h-parameter model as shown is suited to low-frequency, small-signal analysis. For high-frequency analyses the inter-electrode capacitances that are important at high frequencies must be added.\n\n\nEtymology of hFE[edit]\n\nThe h refers to its being an h-parameter, a set of parameters named for their origin in a hybrid equivalent circuit model. F is from forward current amplification also called the current gain. E refers to the transistor operating in a common emitter (CE) configuration. Capital letters used in the subscript indicate that hFE refers to a direct current circuit.\n\n\nIndustry models[edit]\n\n\t\tThis section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it.  (January 2015)\n\n\n\nThe Gummel\u2013Poon SPICE model is often used, but it suffers from several limitations. These have been addressed in various more advanced models: Mextram, VBIC, HICUM, Modella.[32][33][34][35]\n\n\nApplications[edit]\n\nThe BJT remains a device that excels in some applications, such as discrete circuit design, due to the very wide selection of BJT types available, and because of its high transconductance and output resistance compared to MOSFETs.\n\nThe BJT is also the choice for demanding analog circuits, especially for very-high-frequency applications, such as radio-frequency circuits for wireless systems.\n\n\nHigh-speed digital logic[edit]\n\nEmitter-coupled logic (ECL) use BJTs.\n\nBipolar transistors can be combined with MOSFETs in an integrated circuit by using a BiCMOS process of wafer fabrication to create circuits that take advantage of the application strengths of both types of transistor.\n\n\nAmplifiers[edit]\n\nMain article: Electronic amplifier\n\nThe transistor parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 characterizes the current gain of the BJT. It is this gain that allows BJTs to be used as the building blocks of electronic amplifiers. The three main BJT amplifier topologies are:\n\n\n\tCommon emitter\n\tCommon base\n\tCommon collector\n\n\nTemperature sensors[edit]\n\nMain article: Silicon bandgap temperature sensor\n\nBecause of the known temperature and current dependence of the forward-biased base\u2013emitter junction voltage, the BJT can be used to measure temperature by subtracting two voltages at two different bias currents in a known ratio.[36]\n\n\nLogarithmic converters[edit]\n\nBecause base\u2013emitter voltage varies as the logarithm of the base\u2013emitter and collector\u2013emitter currents, a BJT can also be used to compute logarithms and anti-logarithms. A diode can also perform these nonlinear functions but the transistor provides more circuit flexibility.\n\n\nVulnerabilities[edit]\n\nExposure of the transistor to ionizing radiation causes radiation damage. Radiation causes a buildup of 'defects' in the base region that act as recombination centers. The resulting reduction in minority carrier lifetime causes gradual loss of gain of the transistor.\n\nTransistors have \"maximum ratings\", including power ratings (essentially limited by self-heating), maximum collector and base currents (both continuous/DC ratings and peak), and breakdown voltage ratings, beyond which the device may fail or at least perform badly.\n\nIn addition to normal breakdown ratings of the device, power BJTs are subject to a failure mode called secondary breakdown, in which excessive current and normal imperfections in the silicon die cause portions of the silicon inside the device to become disproportionately hotter than the others. The electrical resistivity of doped silicon, like other semiconductors, has a negative temperature coefficient, meaning that it conducts more current at higher temperatures. Thus, the hottest part of the die conducts the most current, causing its conductivity to increase, which then causes it to become progressively hotter again, until the device fails internally. The thermal runaway process associated with secondary breakdown, once triggered, occurs almost instantly and may catastrophically damage the transistor package.\n\nIf the emitter-base junction is reverse biased into avalanche or Zener mode and charge flows for a short period of time, the current gain of the BJT will be permanently degraded.\n\n\nSee also[edit]\n\n\n\tElectronics portal\n\n\n\n\tMOSFET\n\tBipolar transistor biasing\n\tGummel plot\n\tTechnology CAD (TCAD)\n\n\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n\t^ Some metals, such as aluminium have significant hole bands.[1]\n\n\t^ See point-contact transistor for the historical origin of these names.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n\t^ Ashcroft and Mermin (1976).

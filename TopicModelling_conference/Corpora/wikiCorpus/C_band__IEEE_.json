The  C band (4 to 8\u00a0GHz) is used for many satellite communications transmissions, some Wi-Fi devices, some cordless telephones as well as some surveillance and weather radar systems. \n\nThe communications C band was the first frequency band that was allocated for commercial telecommunications via satellites.  The same frequencies were already in use for terrestrial microwave radio relay chains.  Nearly all C-band communication satellites use the band of frequencies from 3.7 to 4.2\u00a0GHz for their downlinks, and the band of frequencies from 5.925\u00a0to 6.425\u00a0GHz for their uplinks. Note that by using the band from 3.7 to 4.0\u00a0GHz, this C band overlaps somewhat into the IEEE S band for radars.\n\nThe C-band communication satellites typically have 24 radio transponders spaced 20\u00a0MHz apart, but with the adjacent transponders on opposite polarizations.[2] In that configuration, the transponders on the same polarization are always 40\u00a0MHz apart. Of this 40\u00a0MHz, each transponder utilizes about 36\u00a0MHz. (The unused 4.0\u00a0MHz between the pairs of transponders acts as \"guard bands\" for the likely case of imperfections in the microwave electronics.)\n\nOne use of the C band is for satellite communication, whether for full-time satellite television networks or raw satellite feeds, although subscription programming also exists. This use contrasts with direct-broadcast satellite, which is a completely closed system used to deliver subscription programming to small satellite dishes that are connected with proprietary receiving equipment.\n\nThe satellite communications portion of the C band is highly associated with television receive-only satellite reception systems, commonly called \"big dish\" systems, since small receiving antennas are not optimal for C-band systems. Typical antenna sizes on C-band capable systems ranges from 7.5 to 12\u00a0feet (2.5 to 3.5\u00a0meters) on consumer satellite dishes, although larger ones also can be used.  For satellite communications, the microwave frequencies of the C band perform better under adverse weather conditions in comparison with the Ku band (11.2 GHz to 14.5\u00a0GHz), microwave frequencies used by other communication satellites.[3] Rain fade \u2013\u00a0the collective name for the negative effects of adverse weather conditions on transmission\u00a0\u2013 is mostly a consequence of precipitation and moisture in the air.\n\nThe C band also includes the 5.8\u00a0GHz ISM band between 5.725 - 5.875\u00a0GHz, which is used for medical and industrial heating applications and many unlicensed short range microwave communication systems, such as cordless phones, baby monitors, and keyless entry systems for vehicles.   The C-band frequencies of 5.4\u00a0GHz band [5.15 to 5.35\u00a0GHz, 5.47 to 5.725\u00a0GHz, or 5.725 to 5.875\u00a0GHz, depending on the region of the world] are used for IEEE 802.11a Wi-Fi wireless computer networks.\n\n\nContents\n\n\n\t1 C-Band Alliance\n\t2 Differences in frequency range by geographic area\n\t3 Amateur radio\n\t4 Particle accelerators\n\t5 References\n\t6 External links\n\n\n\n\n\nC-Band Alliance[edit]\n\nIn response to a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking of July 2018 from the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to make the 3.7 to 4.2\u00a0GHz spectrum available for next-generation terrestrial fixed and mobile broadband\nservices,[4]  in September 2018 the C-Band Alliance (CBA) was established by the four satellite operators, Intelsat, SES, Eutelsat and Telesat that provide the majority of C-band satellite services in the US, including media distribution reaching 100 million US households. The consortium's proposal to the FCC is to act as a facilitator for the clearing and repurposing of a 200\u00a0MHz portion of C-band spectrum to accelerate the deployment of next generation 5G services while protecting incumbent users and their content distribution and data networks in the US from potential interference.[5][6]\n\n\nDifferences in frequency range by geographic area[edit]\n\nSlight variations in the assignments of C-band frequencies have been approved for use in various parts of the world, depending on their locations in the three ITU radio regions. Note that one region includes all of Europe and Africa, plus all of Russia; a second includes all of the Americas, and the third region includes all of Asia outside of Russia, plus Australia and New Zealand. This latter region is the most populous one, since it includes China, India, Pakistan, Japan, and Southeast Asia.\n\n\n\n\tC-Band Variations Around The World\n\n\tBand\n\tTransmit\u00a0Frequency\n(GHz)\n\tReceive\u00a0Frequency\n(GHz)\n\n\tStandard C Band\n\t5.850\u20136.425\n\t3.625\u20134.200\n\n\tSuper Extended C Band\n\t6.425\u20136.725\n\t3.400\u20133.625\n\n\tINSAT / ITU Appendix 30B\n\t6.725\u20137.025\n\t4.500\u20134.800\n\n\tRussian C Band\n\t5.975\u20136.475\n\t3.650\u20134.150\n\n\tLMI C Band\n\t5.7250\u20136.025\n\t3.700\u20134.000\n\n\n\n\nAmateur radio[edit]\n\nThe Radio Regulations of the International Telecommunication Union allow amateur radio operations in the frequency range 5.650 to 5.925\u00a0GHz, and amateur satellite operations are allowed in the ranges 5.830 to 5.850\u00a0GHz for down-links and 5.650 to 5.670\u00a0GHz for up-links.  This is known as the 5-centimeter band by amateurs and the C band by AMSAT.\n\n\nParticle accelerators[edit]\n\nParticle accelerators may be powered by C-band RF sources. The frequencies are then standardized at 5.996\u00a0GHz (Europe) or 5.712\u00a0GHz (US),[7] which is the second harmonic of S band.\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n\t^ Peebles, Peyton Z., Jr, (1998), Radar Principles, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., p 20\n\n\t^ \"North & South America - LyngSat\". www.lyngsat.com.

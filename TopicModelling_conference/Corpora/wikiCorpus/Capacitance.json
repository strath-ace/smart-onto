There are two closely related notions of capacitance: self capacitance and mutual capacitance. Any object that can be electrically charged exhibits self capacitance. A material with a large self capacitance holds more electric charge at a given voltage than one with low capacitance. The notion of mutual capacitance is particularly important for understanding the operations of the capacitor, one of the three elementary linear electronic components (along with resistors and inductors).\n\nThe capacitance is a function only of the geometry of the design (e.g. area of the plates and the distance between them) and the permittivity of the dielectric material between the plates of the capacitor. For many dielectric materials, the permittivity and thus the capacitance, is independent of the potential difference between the conductors and the total charge on them.\n\nThe SI unit of capacitance is the farad (symbol: F), named after the English physicist Michael Faraday. A 1 farad capacitor, when charged with 1 coulomb of electrical charge, has a potential difference of 1 volt between its plates.[1] The reciprocal of capacitance is called elastance.\n\n\nContents\n\n\n\t1 Self capacitance\n\t2 Mutual capacitance\n\t2.1 Capacitance matrix\n\n\n\n\t3 Capacitors\n\t4 Stray capacitance\n\t5 Capacitance of conductors with simple shapes\n\t6 Energy storage\n\t7 Nanoscale systems\n\t7.1 Single-electron devices\n\t7.2 Few-electron devices\n\n\n\n\t8 Capacitance in electronic and semiconductor devices\n\t9 Negative capacitance in semiconductor devices\n\t10 Measuring capacitance\n\t11 See also\n\t12 References\n\t13 Further reading\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf capacitance[edit]\n\nIn electrical circuits, the term capacitance is usually a shorthand for the mutual capacitance between two adjacent conductors, such as the two plates of a capacitor. However, for an isolated conductor, there also exists a property called self capacitance, which is the amount of electric charge that must be added to an isolated conductor to raise its electric potential by one unit (i.e. one volt, in most measurement systems).[2] The reference point for this potential is a theoretical hollow conducting sphere, of infinite radius, with the conductor centered inside this sphere.\n\nMathematically, the self capacitance of a conductor is defined by\n\n\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        C\n        =\n        \n          \n            q\n            V\n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C={\\frac {q}{V}},}\n  \n\n\n\nwhere\n\n\n\tq is the charge held by the conductor,\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        V\n        =\n        \n          \n            1\n            \n              4\n              \u03c0\n              \n                \u03b5\n                \n                  0\n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \u222b\n        \n          \n            \u03c3\n            r\n          \n        \n        \n        d\n        S\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V={1 \\over 4\\pi \\varepsilon _{0}}\\int {\\sigma  \\over r}\\,dS}\n  \n is the electric potential,\n\t\u03c3 is the surface charge density.\n\tdS is an infinitesimal element of area,\n\tr is the length from dS to a fixed point M within the plate\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u03b5\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\varepsilon _{0}}\n  \n is the vacuum permittivity\n\n\nUsing this method, the self capacitance of a conducting sphere of radius R is:[3]\n\n\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        C\n        =\n        4\n        \u03c0\n        \n          \u03b5\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        R\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C=4\\pi \\varepsilon _{0}R\\,}\n  \n\n\n\nExample values of self capacitance are:\n\n\n\tfor the top \"plate\" of a van de Graaff generator, typically a sphere 20\u00a0cm in radius: 22.24 pF,\n\tthe planet Earth: about 710 \u00b5F.[4]\n\n\nThe inter-winding capacitance of a coil is sometimes called self capacitance,[5] but this is a different phenomenon. It is actually mutual capacitance between the individual turns of the coil and is a form of stray, or parasitic capacitance. This self-capacitance is an important consideration at high frequencies: It changes the impedance of the coil and gives rise to parallel resonance. In many applications this is an undesirable effect and sets an upper frequency limit for the correct operation of the circuit.[citation needed]\n\n\nMutual capacitance[edit]\n\nMain article: Mutual capacitance\n\nA common form is a parallel-plate capacitor, which consists of two conductive plates insulated from each other, usually sandwiching a dielectric material. In a parallel plate capacitor, capacitance is very nearly proportional to the surface area of the conductor plates and inversely proportional to the separation distance between the plates.\n\nIf the charges on the plates are +q and \u2212q, and V gives the voltage between the plates, then the capacitance C is given by\n\n\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        C\n        =\n        \n          \n            q\n            V\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C={\\frac {q}{V}}.}\n  \n\n\n\nwhich gives the voltage/current relationship\n\n\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        i\n        (\n        t\n        )\n        =\n        C\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                d\n              \n              v\n              (\n              t\n              )\n            \n            \n              \n                d\n              \n              t\n            \n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle i(t)=C{\\frac {\\mathrm {d} v(t)}{\\mathrm {d} t}}.}\n  \n\n\n\nThe energy stored in a capacitor is found by integrating the work W:\n\n\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            charging\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            1\n            2\n          \n        \n        C\n        \n          V\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W_{\\text{charging}}={\\frac {1}{2}}CV^{2}}\n  \n\n\n\nCapacitance matrix[edit]\n\nThe discussion above is limited to the case of two conducting plates, although of arbitrary size and shape.\nThe definition\n\n  \n    \n      \n        C\n        =\n        Q\n        \n          /\n        \n        V\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C=Q/V}\n  \n does not apply when there are more than two charged plates, or when the net charge on the two plates is non-zero.

The most common subunits of capacitance in use today are the microfarad (\u00b5F), nanofarad (nF), picofarad (pF), and, in microcircuits, femtofarad (fF). However, specially made supercapacitors can be much larger (as much as hundreds of farads), and parasitic capacitive elements can be less than a femtofarad. In the past, alternate subunits were used in historical electronic books; \"mfd\" and \"mf\" for microfarad (\u00b5F); \"mmfd\", \"mmf\", \"\u00b5\u00b5F\" for picofarad (pF); but are rarely used any more.[9][10]\n\nCapacitance can be calculated if the geometry of the conductors and the dielectric properties of the insulator between the conductors are known. A qualitative explanation for this can be given as follows.\n Once a positive charge is put unto a conductor, this charge creates an electrical field, repelling any other positive charge to be moved onto the conductor; i.e., increasing the necessary voltage. But if nearby there is another conductor with a negative charge on it, the electrical field of the positive conductor repelling the second positive charge is weakened (the second positive charge also feels the attracting force of the negative charge). So due to the second conductor with a negative charge, it becomes easier to put a positive charge on the already positive charged first conductor, and vice versa; i.e., the necessary voltage is lowered. \n As a quantitative example consider the capacitance of a capacitor constructed of two parallel plates both of area A separated by a distance d. If d is sufficiently small with respect to the smallest chord of A, there holds, to a high level of accuracy:\n\n\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        \u00a0\n        C\n        =\n        \n          \u03b5\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            A\n            d\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\ C=\\varepsilon _{0}{\\frac {A}{d}}}\n  \n\n\n\nwhere\n\n\n\tC is the capacitance, in farads;\n\tA is the area of overlap of the two plates, in square meters;\n\t\u03b50 is the electric constant (\u03b50\u00a0\u2248 8.854\u00d710\u221212\u00a0F\u22c5m\u22121); and\n\td is the separation between the plates, in meters;\n\n\nCapacitance is proportional to the area of overlap and inversely proportional to the separation between conducting sheets. The closer the sheets are to each other, the greater the capacitance.\nThe equation is a good approximation if d is small compared to the other dimensions of the plates so that the electric field in the capacitor area is uniform, and the so-called fringing field around the periphery provides only a small contribution to the capacitance.\n\nCombining the equation for capacitance with the above equation for the energy stored in a capacitance, for a flat-plate capacitor the energy stored is:\n\n\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          W\n          \n            stored\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            1\n            2\n          \n        \n        C\n        \n          V\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            1\n            2\n          \n        \n        \n          \u03b5\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            A\n            d\n          \n        \n        \n          V\n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle W_{\\text{stored}}={\\frac {1}{2}}CV^{2}={\\frac {1}{2}}\\varepsilon _{0}{\\frac {A}{d}}V^{2}.}\n  \n\n\n\nwhere W is the energy, in joules; C is the capacitance, in farads; and V is the voltage, in volts.\n\n\nStray capacitance[edit]\n\nMain article: Parasitic capacitance\n\nAny two adjacent conductors can function as a capacitor, though the capacitance is small unless the conductors are close together for long distances or over a large area. This (often unwanted) capacitance is called parasitic or \"stray capacitance\". Stray capacitance can allow signals to leak between otherwise isolated circuits (an effect called crosstalk), and it can be a limiting factor for proper functioning of circuits at high frequency.\n\nStray capacitance between the input and output in amplifier circuits can be troublesome because it can form a path for feedback, which can cause instability and parasitic oscillation in the amplifier. It is often convenient for analytical purposes to replace this capacitance with a combination of one input-to-ground capacitance and one output-to-ground capacitance; the original configuration \u2014 including the input-to-output capacitance \u2014 is often referred to as a pi-configuration. Miller's theorem can be used to effect this replacement: it states that, if the gain ratio of two nodes is 1/K, then an impedance of Z connecting the two nodes can be replaced with a Z/(1\u00a0\u2212\u00a0k) impedance between the first node and ground and a KZ/(K\u00a0\u2212\u00a01) impedance between the second node and ground. Since impedance varies inversely with capacitance, the internode capacitance, C, is replaced by a capacitance of KC from input to ground and a capacitance of (K\u00a0\u2212\u00a01)C/K from output to ground. When the input-to-output gain is very large, the equivalent input-to-ground impedance is very small while the output-to-ground impedance is essentially equal to the original (input-to-output) impedance.\n\n\nCapacitance of conductors with simple shapes[edit]\n\nCalculating the capacitance of a system amounts to solving the Laplace equation \u22072\u03c6\u00a0=\u00a00 with a constant potential \u03c6 on the 2-dimensional surface of the conductors embedded in 3-space. This is simplified by symmetries. There is no solution in terms of elementary functions in more complicated cases.\n\nFor plane situations analytic functions may be used to map different geometries to each other.

In particular, the electrostatic potential difference experienced by electrons in conventional capacitors is spatially well-defined and fixed by the shape and size of metallic electrodes in addition to the statistically large number of electrons present in conventional capacitors. In nanoscale capacitors, however, the electrostatic potentials experienced by electrons are determined by the number and locations of all electrons that contribute to the electronic properties of the device. In such devices, the number of electrons may be very small, however, the resulting spatial distribution of equipotential surfaces within the device are exceedingly complex.\n\n\nSingle-electron devices[edit]\n\nThe capacitance of a connected, or \"closed\", single-electron device is twice the capacitance of an unconnected, or \"open\", single-electron device.[19] This fact may be traced more fundamentally to the energy stored in the single-electron device whose \"direct polarization\" interaction energy may be equally divided into the interaction of the electron with the polarized charge on the device itself due to the presence of the electron and the amount of potential energy required to form the polarized charge on the device (the interaction of charges in the device's dielectric material with the potential due to the electron).[20]\n\n\nFew-electron devices[edit]\n\nThe derivation of a \"quantum capacitance\" of a few-electron device involves the thermodynamic chemical potential of an N-particle system given by\n\n\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03bc\n        (\n        N\n        )\n        =\n        U\n        (\n        N\n        )\n        \u2212\n        U\n        (\n        N\n        \u2212\n        1\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mu (N)=U(N)-U(N-1)}\n  \n\n\n\nwhose energy terms may be obtained as solutions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.

The primary differences between nanoscale capacitors and macroscopic (conventional) capacitors are the number of excess electrons (charge carriers, or electrons, that contribute to the device's electronic behavior) and the shape and size of metallic electrodes. In nanoscale devices, nanowires consisting of metal atoms typically do not exhibit the same conductive properties as their macroscopic, or bulk material, counterparts.\n\n\nCapacitance in electronic and semiconductor devices[edit]\n\nIn electronic and semiconductor devices, transient or frequency-dependent current between terminals contains both conduction and displacement components. Conduction current is related to moving charge carriers (electrons, holes, ions, etc.), while displacement current is caused by time-varying electric field. Carrier transport is affected by electric field and by a number of physical phenomena - such as carrier drift and diffusion, trapping, injection, contact-related effects, impact ionization, etc. As a result, device admittance is frequency-dependent, and a simple electrostatic formula for capacitance \n  \n    \n      \n        C\n        =\n        q\n        \n          /\n        \n        V\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C=q/V,}\n  \n is not applicable.

At high frequencies, capacitance approached a constant value, equal to \"geometric\" capacitance, determined by the terminals' geometry and dielectric content in the device.\nA paper by Steven Laux[23] presents a review of numerical techniques for capacitance calculation. In particular, capacitance can be calculated by a Fourier transform of a transient current in response to a step-like voltage excitation:\n\n\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        C\n        (\n        \u03c9\n        )\n        =\n        1\n        \n          /\n        \n        (\n        \u0394\n        V\n        )\n        \n          \u222b\n          \n            0\n          \n          \n            \u221e\n          \n        \n        [\n        i\n        (\n        t\n        )\n        \u2212\n        i\n        (\n        \u221e\n        )\n        ]\n        c\n        o\n        s\n        (\n        \u03c9\n        t\n        )\n        d\n        t\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C(\\omega )=1/(\\Delta V)\\int _{0}^{\\infty }[i(t)-i(\\infty )]cos(\\omega t)dt.}\n  \n\n\n\nNegative capacitance in semiconductor devices[edit]\n\nUsually, capacitance in semiconductor devices is positive. However, in some devices and under certain conditions (temperature, applied voltages, frequency, etc.), capacitance can become negative. Non-monotonic behavior of the transient current in response to a step-like excitation has been proposed as the mechanism of negative capacitance.[24] Negative capacitance has been demonstrated and explored in many different types of semiconductor devices.[25]\n\n\nMeasuring capacitance[edit]\n\nMain article: Capacitance meter\n\nA capacitance meter is a piece of electronic test equipment used to measure capacitance, mainly of discrete capacitors. For most purposes and in most cases the capacitor must be disconnected from circuit. \n\nMany DVMs (digital volt meters) have a capacitance-measuring function. These usually operate by charging and discharging the capacitor under test with a known current and measuring the rate of rise of the resulting voltage; the slower the rate of rise, the larger the capacitance. DVMs can usually measure capacitance from nanofarads to a few hundred microfarads, but wider ranges are not unusual.  It is also possible to measure capacitance by passing a known high-frequency alternating current through the device under test and measuring the resulting voltage across it (does not work for polarised capacitors).\n\n\n  \nAn Andeen-Hagerling 2700A capacitance bridge\n\n\n\nMore sophisticated instruments use other techniques such as inserting the capacitor-under-test into a bridge circuit. By varying the values of the other legs in the bridge (so as to bring the bridge into balance), the value of the unknown capacitor is determined. This method of indirect use of measuring capacitance ensures greater precision. Through the use of Kelvin connections and other careful design techniques, these instruments can usually measure capacitors over a range from picofarads to farads.\n\n\nSee also[edit]\n\n\tCapacitive displacement sensor\n\tCapacity of a set\n\tQuantum capacitance\n\tConductance\n\tDisplacement current\n\tAmp\u00e8re's law\n\tGauss law\n\tHydraulic analogy\n\tMagnetocapacitance\n\tRKM code\n\tLCR meter\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n\t^ \"Definition of 'farad'\".

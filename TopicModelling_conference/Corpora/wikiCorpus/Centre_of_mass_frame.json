The center of momentum of a system is not a location (but a collection of relative momenta/velocities: a reference frame). Thus \"center of momentum\" means \"center-of-momentum frame\" and is a short form of this phrase.[1]\n\nA special case of the center-of-momentum frame is the center-of-mass frame: an inertial frame in which the center of mass (which is a physical point) remains at the origin. In all COM frames, the center of mass is at rest, but it is not necessarily at the origin of the coordinate system.\n\nIn special relativity, the COM frame is necessarily unique only when the system is isolated.\n\n\nContents\n\n\n\t1 Properties\n\t1.1 General\n\t1.2 Special relativity\n\n\n\n\t2 Two-body problem\n\t3 See also\n\t4 References\n\n\n\n\n\nProperties[edit]\n\nGeneral[edit]\n\nThe center of momentum frame is defined as the inertial frame in which the sum of the linear momenta of all particles is equal to 0.

This is a consequence of Noether's theorem. In the COM frame the total energy of the system is the rest energy, and this quantity (when divided by the factor c2, where c is the speed of light) gives the rest mass (invariant mass) of the system:\n\n\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          m\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              E\n              \n                0\n              \n            \n            \n              c\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n          \n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m_{0}={\\frac {E_{0}}{c^{2}}}.}\n  \n\n\n\nThe invariant mass of the system is given in any inertial frame by the relativistic invariant relation\n\n\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          m\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        \n          \n\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            (\n            \n              \n                E\n                \n                  c\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            )\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \u2212\n        \n          \n            (\n            \n              \n                p\n                c\n              \n            \n            )\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m_{0}{}^{2}=\\left({\\frac {E}{c^{2}}}\\right)^{2}-\\left({\\frac {p}{c}}\\right)^{2},}\n  \n\n\n\nbut for zero momentum the momentum term (p/c)2 vanishes and thus the total energy coincides with the rest energy.\n\nSystems that have nonzero energy but zero rest mass (such as photons moving in a single direction, or equivalently, plane electromagnetic waves) do not have COM frames, because there is no frame in which they have zero net momentum. Due to the invariance of the speed of light, a massless system must travel at the speed of light in any frame, and always possesses a net momentum. Its energy is\u2014for each reference frame\u2014equal to the magnitude of momentum multiplied by the speed of light:\n\n\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        E\n        =\n        p\n        c\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle E=pc.}\n  \n\n\n\nTwo-body problem[edit]\n\nAn example of the usage of this frame is given below \u2013 in a two-body collision, not necessarily elastic (where kinetic energy is conserved).  The COM frame can be used to find the momentum of the particles much easier than in a lab frame: the frame where the measurement or calculation is done.  The situation is analyzed using Galilean transformations and conservation of momentum (for generality, rather than kinetic energies alone), for two particles of mass m1 and m2, moving at initial velocities (before collision) u1 and u2 respectively.  The transformations are applied to take the velocity of the frame from the velocity of each particle from the lab frame (unprimed quantities) to the COM frame (primed quantities):[1]\n\n\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            u\n          \n          \n            1\n          \n          \n            \u2032\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            u\n          \n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        \u2212\n        \n          V\n        \n        ,\n        \n        \n          \n            u\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n          \n            \u2032\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            u\n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \u2212\n        \n          V\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {u} _{1}^{\\prime }=\\mathbf {u} _{1}-\\mathbf {V} ,\\quad \\mathbf {u} _{2}^{\\prime }=\\mathbf {u} _{2}-\\mathbf {V} }\n  \n\n\n\nwhere V is the velocity of the COM frame.

calculation of the momenta of both particles; the reduced mass and relative velocity can be calculated from the initial velocities in the lab frame and the masses, and the momentum of one particle is simply the negative of the other. The calculation can be repeated for final velocities v1 and v2 in place of the initial velocities u1 and u2, since after the collision the velocities still satisfy the above equations:[3]\n\n\n\t\n

As opposed to traditional rocket engines, a cold gas thruster does not house any combustion and therefore has lower thrust and efficiency compared to conventional monopropellant and bipropellant rocket engines. Cold gas thrusters have been referred to as the \"simplest manifestation of a rocket engine\" because their design consists only of a fuel tank, a regulating valve, a propelling nozzle, and the little required plumbing. They are the cheapest, simplest, and most reliable propulsion systems available for orbital maintenance, maneuvering and attitude control.[1] \n\nCold gas thrusters are predominantly used to provide stabilization for smaller space missions which require contaminant-free operation.[2] Specifically, CubeSat propulsion system development has been the predominantly focused on cold gas systems because CubeSats have strict regulations against pyrotechnics and hazardous materials.[3]\n\n\nContents\n\n\n\t1 Design\n\t2 Performance\n\t2.1 Advantages\n\t2.2 Disadvantages\n\t2.3 Thrust\n\t2.4 Specific Impulse\n\n\n\n\t3 Propellants\n\t4 Applications\n\t4.1 Human Propulsion\n\t4.1.1 Hand-Held Maneuvering Unit\n\t4.1.2 Manned Maneuvering Unit\n\n\n\n\t4.2 Vernier Engines\n\t4.3 Automotive\n\n\n\n\t5 Current Research\n\t6 See also\n\t7 References\n\n\n\n\n\nDesign[edit]\n\n  \nSchematic of a cold gas propulsion system\n\n\n\nThe nozzle of a cold gas thruster is generally a convergent-divergent nozzle that provides the required thrust in flight. The nozzle is shaped such that the high-pressure, low-velocity gas that enters the nozzle is compressed as it approaches the throat (the narrowest part of the nozzle), where the gas velocity matches the speed of sound.[1]\n\n\n\nPerformance[edit]\n\nCold gas thrusters benefit from their simplicity; however, they do fall short in other respects. The following list summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of a cold gas system.\n\n\nAdvantages[edit]\n\n\tA lack of combustion in the nozzle of a cold gas thruster allows its usage in situations where regular liquid rocket engines would be too hot. This eliminates the need to engineer heat management systems.\n\tThe simple design allows the thrusters to be smaller than regular rocket engines; which makes them a suitable choice for missions with limited volume and weight requirements.\n\tThe cold gas system and its fuel are inexpensive compared to regular rocket engines.[1]\n\tThe simple design is less prone to failures than a traditional rocket engine.[1]\n\tThe fuels used in a cold gas system are safe to handle both before and after firing the engine. If inert fuel is used the cold gas system is one of the safest possible rocket engines.[2]\n\tCold gas thrusters do not build up a net charge on the spacecraft during operation.\n\tCold gas thrusters require very little electrical energy to operate, which is useful, for example, when a spacecraft is in the shadow of the planet it is orbiting.\n\n\nDisadvantages[edit]\n\n\tA cold gas system cannot produce the high thrust that combustive rocket engines can achieve.\n\tCold gas thrusters are less mass efficient than traditional rocket engines.\n\tThe maximum thrust of a cold gas thruster is dependent upon the pressure in the storage tank. As fuel is used up, the pressure decreases and maximum thrust decreases.[4]\n\n\nThrust[edit]\n\nThrust is generated by momentum exchange between the exhaust and the spacecraft, which is given by Newton's second law as \n  \n    \n      \n        F\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              m\n              \u02d9\n            \n          \n        \n        \n          V\n          \n            e\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle F={\\dot {m}}V_{e}}\n  \nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              m\n              \u02d9\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\dot {m}}}\n  \nis the mass flow rate, and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          V\n          \n            e\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V_{e}}\n  \nis the velocity of the exhaust.\n\nIn the case of a cold gas thruster in space, where the thrusters are designed for infinite expansion (since the ambient pressure is zero), the thrust is given as\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        F\n        =\n        \n          A\n          \n            t\n          \n        \n        \n          P\n          \n            c\n          \n        \n        \u03b3\n        \n          [\n          \n            \n              (\n              \n                \n                  2\n                  \n                    \u03b3\n                    \u2212\n                    1\n                  \n                \n              \n              )\n            \n            \n              (\n              \n                \n                  2\n                  \n                    \u03b3\n                    +\n                    1\n                  \n                \n              \n              )\n            \n            \n              (\n              \n                1\n                \u2212\n                \n                  \n                    \n                      P\n                      \n                        e\n                      \n                    \n                    \n                      P\n                      \n                        c\n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n              )\n            \n          \n          ]\n        \n        +\n        \n          P\n          \n            e\n          \n        \n        \n          A\n          \n            e\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle F=A_{t}P_{c}\\gamma \\left[\\left({\\frac {2}{\\gamma -1}}\\right)\\left({\\frac {2}{\\gamma +1}}\\right)\\left(1-{\\frac {P_{e}}{P_{c}}}\\right)\\right]+P_{e}A_{e}}\n  \n\n\nWhere \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          A\n          \n            t\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A_{t}}\n  \nis the area of the throat, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          P\n          \n            c\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle P_{c}}\n  \nis the chamber pressure in the nozzle, \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b3\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\gamma }\n  \nis the specific heat ratio, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          P\n          \n            e\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle P_{e}}\n  \nis the exit pressure of the propellant, and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          A\n          \n            e\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle A_{e}}\n  \nis the exit area of the nozzle.[1]\n\n\nSpecific Impulse[edit]\n\nThe specific impulse (Isp) of a rocket engine is the most important metric of efficiency; a high specific impulse is normally desired.

The thrusters provided full 6-degree-of-freedom control to the astronaut wearing the MMU. Each thruster provided 1.4 lbs (6.23 N) of thrust. The two propellant tanks onboard provided a total of 40 lbs (18kg) of gaseous nitrogen at 4500 psi, which provided sufficient propellant to generate a change in velocity of 110 to 135 ft/sec (33.53 to 41.15 m/s). At a nominal mass, the MMU had a translational acceleration of 0.3\u00b10.05 ft/sec2 (9.1\u00b11.5 cm/s2) and a rotational acceleration of 10.0\u00b13.0 deg/sec2 (0.1745\u00b10.052 rad/sec2)[7]\n\n\nVernier Engines[edit]\n\nMain article: Vernier Engines\n\nLarger cold gas thrusters are employed to help in the attitude control of the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket as it returns to land.[8]\n\n\nAutomotive[edit]\n\nIn a tweet in June 2018, Elon Musk proposed the use of air-based cold gas thrusters to improve car performance.[9]\n\nIn September 2018, Bosch successfully tested its proof-of-concept safety system for righting a slipping motorcycle using cold gas thrusters. The system senses a sideways wheel slip and uses a lateral cold gas thruster to keep the motorcycle from slipping further.[10]\n\n\nCurrent Research[edit]\n\nThe main focus of current research is miniaturization of cold gas thrusters using microelectromecanical systems.[11]\n\n\nSee also[edit]\n\n\tResistojet rocket\n\tMonopropellant Rocket\n\tCubeSat\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n\t^ a b c d e f Anis, Assad (2012-06-13), \"Cold Gas Propulsion System - An Ideal Choice for Remote Sensing Small Satellites\", Remote Sensing - Advanced Techniques and Platforms, InTech, doi:10.5772/37149, ISBN\u00a09789535106524\n\n\t^ a b c Nguyen, Hugo; K\u00f6hler, Johan; Stenmark, Lars (2002-01-01). \"The merits of cold gas micropropulsion in state-of-the-art space missions\".

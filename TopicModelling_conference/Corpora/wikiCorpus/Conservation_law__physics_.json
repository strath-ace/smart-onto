For the legal aspects of environmental conservation, see Environmental law and Conservation movement. For other uses, see Conservation (disambiguation).\n\nIn physics, a conservation law states that a particular measurable property of an isolated physical system does not change as the system evolves over time. Exact conservation laws include conservation of energy, conservation of linear momentum, conservation of angular momentum, and conservation of electric charge. There are also many approximate conservation laws, which apply to such quantities as mass, parity, lepton number, baryon number, strangeness, hypercharge, etc.  These quantities are conserved in certain classes of physics processes, but not in all.\n\nA local conservation law is usually expressed mathematically as a continuity equation, a partial differential equation which gives a relation between the amount of the quantity and the \"transport\" of that quantity.    It states that the amount of the conserved quantity at a point or within a volume can only change by the amount of the quantity which flows in or out of the volume.\n\nFrom Noether's theorem, each conservation law is associated with a symmetry in the underlying physics.\n\n\nContents\n\n\n\t1 Conservation laws as fundamental laws of nature\n\t2 Exact laws\n\t3 Approximate laws\n\t4 Global and local conservation laws\n\t5 Differential forms\n\t6 Integral and weak forms\n\t7 See also\n\t7.1 Examples and applications\n\n\n\n\t8 Notes\n\t9 References\n\t10 External links\n\n\n\n\n\nConservation laws as fundamental laws of nature[edit]\n\nConservation laws are fundamental to our understanding of the physical world, in that they describe which processes can or cannot occur in nature.  For example, the conservation law of energy states that the total quantity of energy in an isolated system does not change, though it may change form.  In general, the total quantity of the property governed by that law remains unchanged during physical processes.  With respect to classical physics, conservation laws include conservation of energy, mass (or matter), linear momentum, angular momentum, and electric charge.  With respect to particle physics, particles cannot be created or destroyed except in pairs, where one is ordinary and the other is an antiparticle.  With respect to symmetries and invariance principles, three special conservation laws have been described, associated with inversion or reversal of space, time, and charge.\n\nConservation laws are considered to be fundamental laws of nature, with broad application in physics, as well as in other fields such as chemistry, biology, geology, and engineering.\n\nMost conservation laws are exact, or absolute, in the sense that they apply to all possible processes.  Some conservation laws are partial, in that they hold for some processes but not for others.\n\nOne particularly important result concerning conservation laws is Noether's theorem, which states that there is a one-to-one correspondence between each one of them and a differentiable symmetry of nature.  For example, the conservation of energy follows from the time-invariance of physical systems, and the conservation of angular momentum arises from the fact that physical systems behave the same regardless of how they are oriented in space.\n\n\nExact laws[edit]\n\nA partial listing of physical conservation equations due to symmetry that are said to be exact laws, or more precisely have never been proven to be violated:\n\n\n\tConservation Law\tRespective Noether symmetry invariance\tNumber of dimensions\n\n\tConservation of mass-energy\n\tTime invariance\n\tLorentz invariance symmetry\n\t1\n\ttranslation about time axis\n\n\tConservation of linear momentum\n\tTranslation symmetry\n\t3\n\ttranslation about x,y,z position\n\n\tConservation of angular momentum\n\tRotation invariance\n\t3\n\trotation about x,y,z axes\n\n\tCPT symmetry (combining charge conjugation, parity and time reversal)\n\tLorentz invariance\n\t1\u00a0+\u00a01\u00a0+\u00a01\n\t(charge\u00a0inversion\u00a0q\u00a0\u2192\u00a0\u2212q)\u00a0+\u00a0(position\u00a0inversion r\u00a0\u2192\u00a0\u2212r)\u00a0+\u00a0(time\u00a0inversion t\u00a0\u2192\u00a0\u2212t)\n\n\tConservation of electric charge\n\tGauge invariance\n\t1\u22974\n\tscalar field (1D) in 4D spacetime (x,y,z\u00a0+ time\u00a0evolution)\n\n\tConservation of color charge\n\tSU(3) Gauge invariance\n\t3\n\tr,g,b\n\n\tConservation of weak isospin\n\tSU(2)L Gauge invariance\n\t1\n\tweak charge\n\n\tConservation of probability\n\tProbability invariance[1]\n\t1\u00a0\u2297\u00a04\n\ttotal probability always\u00a0=\u00a01 in whole x,y,z space, during time evolution\n\n\n\nApproximate laws[edit]\n\nThere are also approximate conservation laws.  These are approximately true in particular situations, such as low speeds, short time scales, or certain interactions.\n\n\n\tConservation of rest mass\n\tConservation of baryon number (See chiral anomaly and sphaleron)\n\tConservation of lepton number (In the Standard Model)\n\tConservation of flavor (violated by the weak interaction)\n\tConservation of parity\n\tInvariance under charge conjugation\n\tInvariance under time reversal\n\tCP symmetry, the combination of charge conjugation and parity (equivalent to time reversal if CPT holds)\n\n\nGlobal and local conservation laws[edit]\n\nThe total amount of some conserved quantity in the universe could remain unchanged if an equal amount were to appear at one point A and simultaneously disappear from another separate point B.  For example, an amount of energy could appear on Earth without changing the total amount in the Universe if the same amount of energy were to disappear from a remote region of the Universe.  This weak form of \"global\" conservation is really not a conservation law because it is not Lorentz invariant, so phenomena like the above do not occur in nature.[2][3]  Due to special relativity, if the appearance of the energy at A and disappearance of the energy at B are simultaneous in one inertial reference frame, they will not be simultaneous in other inertial reference frames moving with respect to the first.  In a moving frame one will occur before the other; either the energy at A will appear before or after the energy at B disappears.  In both cases, during the interval energy will not be conserved.  \n\nA stronger form of conservation law requires that, for the amount of a conserved quantity at a point to change, there must be a flow, or flux of the quantity into or out of the point.  For example, the amount of electric charge in a volume is never found to change without an electric current into or out of the volume that carries the difference in charge.  Since it only involves continuous local changes, this stronger type of conservation law is Lorentz invariant; a quantity conserved in one reference frame is conserved in all moving reference frames.[2][3]  This is called a local conservation law.[2][3]  Local conservation also implies global conservation; that the total amount of the conserved quantity in the Universe remains constant.  All of the conservation laws listed above are local conservation laws. A local conservation law is expressed mathematically by a continuity equation, which states that the change in the quantity in a volume is equal to the total net  \"flux\" of the quantity through the surface of the volume.  The following sections discuss continuity equations in general.\n\n\nDifferential forms[edit]\n\nSee also: conservation form and continuity equation\n\nIn continuum mechanics, the most general form of an exact conservation law is given by a continuity equation.

of the latter is substantially that it requires less smoothness of the solution, which paves the way to weak form, extending the class of admissible solutions to include discontinuous solutions.[5] By integrating in any space-time domain the current density form in 1-D space:\n\n\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          y\n          \n            t\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n

theorem, the integral form is:\n\n\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u222b\n          \n            \u2212\n            \u221e\n          \n          \n            \u221e\n          \n

similar fashion, for the scalar multidimensional space, the integral form is:\n\n\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \u222e\n              \n            \n          \n          \n        \n        \u2061\n        [\n        y\n        \n        \n          d\n          \n            N\n          \n        \n        r\n        +\n        j\n        (\n

along the boundary of the domain, in an anticlock-wise manner.[5]\n\nMoreover, by defining a test function \u03c6(r,t) continuously differentiable both in time and space with compact support, the weak form can be obtained pivoting on the initial condition.

It is a scalar that has the units of speed. As used in this context, it is not the same as the physical change in velocity of the vehicle.\n\nAs a simple example, take a conventional rocket which achieves thrust by burning fuel.  Delta-v is the change in velocity that can be achieved by burning that rocket's entire fuel load.\n\nDelta-v is produced by reaction engines, such as rocket engines, and is proportional to the thrust per unit mass and the burn time.  It is used to determine the mass of propellant required for the given maneuver through the Tsiolkovsky rocket equation.\n\nFor multiple maneuvers, delta-v sums linearly.\n\nFor interplanetary missions delta-v is often plotted on a porkchop plot, which displays the required mission delta-v as a function of launch date.\n\n\nContents\n\n\n\t1 Definition\n\t2 Specific cases\n\t3 Orbital maneuvers\n\t4 Production\n\t5 Multiple maneuvers\n\t6 Delta-v budgets\n\t6.1 Oberth effect\n\t6.2 Porkchop plot\n\t6.3 Around the Solar System\n\n\n\n\t7 See also\n\t8 References\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition[edit]\n\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        \u0394\n        \n          v\n        \n        =\n        \n          \u222b\n          \n            \n              t\n              \n                0\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n              t\n              \n                1\n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                |\n              \n              T\n              (\n              t\n              )\n              \n                |\n              \n            \n            \n              m\n              (\n              t\n              )\n            \n          \n        \n        \n        d\n        t\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Delta {v}=\\int _{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}{\\frac {|T(t)|}{m(t)}}\\,dt}\n  \n\n\n\nwhere\n\n\n\tT(t) is the instantaneous thrust at time, t.\n\tm(t) is the instantaneous mass at time, t.\n\n\nSpecific cases[edit]\n\nIn the absence of external forces:\n\n\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        \u0394\n        \n          v\n        \n        =\n        \n          \u222b\n          \n            \n              t\n              \n                0\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n              t\n              \n                1\n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n          |\n          \n            \n              \n                v\n                \u02d9\n              \n            \n          \n          |\n        \n        \n        d\n        t\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Delta {v}=\\int _{t_{0}}^{t_{1}}\\left|{\\dot {v}}\\right|\\,dt}\n  \n\n\n\nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              v\n              \u02d9\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\dot {v}}}\n  \n is the coordinate acceleration.\n\nWhen thrust is applied in a constant direction (v/|v| is constant) this simplifies to:\n\n\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        \u0394\n        \n          v\n        \n        =\n        \n          |\n        \n        \n          v\n          \n            1\n          \n        \n        \u2212\n        \n          v\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        \n          |\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Delta {v}=|v_{1}-v_{0}|}\n  \n\n\n\nwhich is simply the magnitude of the change in velocity. However, this relation does not hold in the general case: if, for instance, a constant, unidirectional acceleration is reversed after (t1\u00a0\u2212\u00a0t0)/2 then the velocity difference is 0, but delta-v is the same as for the non-reversed thrust.\n\nFor rockets the 'absence of external forces' is taken to mean the absence of gravity, atmospheric drag as well as the absence of aerostatic back pressure on the nozzle and hence the vacuum Isp is used for calculating the vehicle's delta-v capacity via the rocket equation. In addition, the costs for atmospheric losses and gravity drag are added into the delta-v budget when dealing with launches from a planetary surface.[1]\n\n\nOrbital maneuvers[edit]\n\nMain article: rocket equation\n\nOrbit maneuvers are made by firing a thruster to produce a reaction force acting on the spacecraft.

But even for geostationary spacecraft using electrical propulsion for out-of-plane control with thruster burn periods extending over several hours around the nodes this approximation is fair.\n\n\nProduction[edit]\n\nDelta-v is typically provided by the thrust of a rocket engine, but can be created by other engines. The time-rate of change of delta-v is the magnitude of the acceleration caused by the engines, i.e., the thrust per total vehicle mass. The actual acceleration vector would be found by adding thrust per mass on to the gravity vector and the vectors representing any other forces acting on the object.\n\nThe total delta-v needed is a good starting point for early design decisions since consideration of the added complexities are deferred to later times in the design process.\n\nThe rocket equation shows that the required amount of propellant dramatically increases with increasing delta-v. Therefore, in modern spacecraft propulsion systems considerable study is put into reducing the total delta-v needed for a given spaceflight, as well as designing spacecraft that are capable of producing larger delta-v.\n\nIncreasing the delta-v provided by a propulsion system can be achieved by:\n\n\n\tstaging\n\tincreasing specific impulse\n\timproving propellant mass fraction\n\n\nMultiple maneuvers[edit]\n\nBecause the mass ratios apply to any given burn, when multiple maneuvers are performed in sequence, the mass ratios multiply.\n\nThus it can be shown that, provided the exhaust velocity is fixed, this means that delta-v can be summed:\n\nWhen m1, m2 are the mass ratios of the maneuvers, and v1, v2 are the delta-v of the first and second maneuvers\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              \n                \n                  m\n                  \n                    1\n                  \n                \n                \n                  m\n                  \n                    2\n                  \n                \n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \n                  e\n                  \n                    \n                      \n                        V\n                        \n                          1\n                        \n                      \n                      \n                        V\n                        \n                          e\n                        \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n                \n                  e\n                  \n                    \n                      \n                        V\n                        \n                          2\n                        \n                      \n                      \n                        V\n                        \n                          e\n                        \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \n                  e\n                  \n                    \n                      \n                        \n                          V\n                          \n                            1\n                          \n                        \n                        +\n                        \n                          V\n                          \n                            2\n                          \n                        \n                      \n                      \n                        V\n                        \n                          e\n                        \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n              \n                \n                =\n                \n                  e\n                  \n                    \n                      V\n                      \n                        V\n                        \n                          e\n                        \n                      \n                    \n                  \n                \n                =\n                M\n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\begin{aligned}m_{1}m_{2}&=e^{\\frac {V_{1}}{V_{e}}}e^{\\frac {V_{2}}{V_{e}}}\\\\&=e^{\\frac {V_{1}+V_{2}}{V_{e}}}\\\\&=e^{\\frac {V}{V_{e}}}=M\\end{aligned}}}\n  \n\n\nWhere V = v1 + v2 and M = m1 m2.\n\nWhich is just the rocket equation applied to the sum of the two maneuvers.\n\nThis is convenient since it means that delta-v can be calculated and simply added and the mass ratio calculated only for the overall vehicle for the entire mission. Thus delta-v is commonly quoted rather than mass ratios which would require multiplication.\n\n\nDelta-v budgets[edit]\n\nMain article: Delta-v budget\n\nWhen designing a trajectory, delta-v budget is used as a good indicator of how much propellant will be required. Propellant usage is an exponential function of delta-v in accordance with the rocket equation, it will also depend on the exhaust velocity.\n\nIt is not possible to determine delta-v requirements from conservation of energy by considering only the total energy of the vehicle in the initial and final orbits since energy is carried away in the exhaust (see also below). For example, most spacecraft are launched in an orbit with inclination fairly near to the latitude at the launch site, to take advantage of the Earth's rotational surface speed. If it is necessary, for mission-based reasons, to put the spacecraft in an orbit of different inclination, a substantial delta-v is required, though the specific kinetic and potential energies in the final orbit and the initial orbit are equal.\n\nWhen rocket thrust is applied in short bursts the other sources of acceleration may be negligible, and the magnitude of the velocity change of one burst may be simply approximated by the delta-v. The total delta-v to be applied can then simply be found by addition of each of the delta-v's needed at the discrete burns, even though between bursts the magnitude and direction of the velocity changes due to gravity, e.g. in an elliptic orbit.\n\nFor examples of calculating delta-v, see Hohmann transfer orbit, gravitational slingshot, and Interplanetary Transport Network. It is also notable that large thrust can reduce gravity drag.\n\nDelta-v is also required to keep satellites in orbit and is expended in propulsive orbital stationkeeping maneuvers. Since the propellant load on most satellites cannot be replenished, the amount of propellant initially loaded on a satellite may well determine its useful lifetime.\n\n\nOberth effect[edit]\n\nMain article: Oberth effect\n\nFrom power considerations, it turns out that when applying delta-v in the direction of the velocity the specific orbital energy gained per unit delta-v is equal to the instantaneous speed. This is called the Oberth effect.\n\nFor example, a satellite in an elliptical orbit is boosted more efficiently at high speed (that is, small altitude) than at low speed (that is, high altitude).\n\nAnother example is that when a vehicle is making a pass of a planet, burning the propellant at closest approach rather than further out gives significantly higher final speed, and this is even more so when the planet is a large one with a deep gravity field, such as Jupiter.\n\nSee also powered slingshots.\n\n\nPorkchop plot[edit]\n\nMain article: Porkchop plot\n\nDue to the relative positions of planets changing over time, different delta-vs are required at different launch dates. A diagram that shows the required delta-v plotted against time is sometimes called a porkchop plot. Such a diagram is useful since it enables calculation of a launch window, since launch should only occur when the mission is within the capabilities of the vehicle to be employed.[4]\n\n\nAround the Solar System[edit]\n\n\n\nDelta-v needed for various orbital manoeuvers using conventional rockets; red arrows show where optional aerobraking can be performed in that particular direction, black numbers give delta-v in km/s that apply in either direction.[5][6] Lower-delta-v transfers than shown can often be achieved, but involve rare transfer windows or take significantly longer, see: fuzzy orbital transfers. The figure 2.5 for LEO to GTO is higher than necessary[7] and the figure of 30 for LEO to the sun is also too high.[8]\n\n\n\tC3\n\tEscape orbit\n\tGEO\n\tGeosynchronous orbit\n\tGTO\n\tGeostationary transfer orbit\n\tL4/5\n\tEarth\u2013Moon L4L5 Lagrangian point\n\tLEO\n\tLow Earth orbit\n\n\n\n\nSee also[edit]\n\n\tDelta-v budget\n\tGravity drag\n\tOrbital maneuver\n\tOrbital stationkeeping\n\tSpacecraft propulsion\n\tSpecific impulse\n\tTsiolkovsky rocket equation\n\tDelta-v (physics)\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n\t^ Sarigul-Klijn, Nesrin; Noel, Chris; Sarigul-Klijn, Martinus (2004-01-05). \"Air Launching Eart-to-Orbit Vehicles: Delta V gains from Launch Conditions and Vehicle Aerodynamics\". doi:10.2514/6.2004-872.

Figures are said to come from Chapter 2 of Space Settlements: A Design Study Archived 2001-11-28 at the Library of Congress Web Archives on the NASA website (dead link).\n\n\t^ The sum of LEO to GTO and GTO to GEO should equal LEO to GEO. The precise figures depend on what low earth orbit is used. According to Geostationary transfer orbit, the speed of a GTO at perigee can be just 9.8 km/s. This corresponds to an LEO at about 700 km altitude, where its speed would be 7.5 km/s, giving a delta-v of 2.3 km/s. Starting from a lower LEO would require more delta-v to get to GTO, but then the total for LEO to GEO would have to be higher.\n\n\t^ The speed of the earth going around the sun is 29.78 km/s, equivalent to a specific kinetic energy of 443 km2/s2. One must add to this the potential energy depth of LEO, about 61 km2/s2, to give a kinetic energy close to Earth of 504 km2/s2, corresponding to a speed of 31.8 km/s. Since the LEO speed is 7.8 km/s, the delta-v is only 24 km/s. It would be possible to reach the sun with less delta-v using gravity assists.

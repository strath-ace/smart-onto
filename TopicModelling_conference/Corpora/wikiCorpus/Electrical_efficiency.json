Where it is not customary or convenient to represent input and output energy in the same units, efficiency-like quantities have units associated with them.  For example, the heat rate of a fossil-fuel power plant may be expressed in BTU per kilowatt-hour. Luminous efficacy of a light source expresses the amount of visible light for a certain amount of power transfer and has the units of lumens per watt.\n\n\nContents\n\n\n\t1 Efficiency of typical electrical devices\n\t2 Efficiency of devices at point of maximum power transfer ...\n\t3 Efficiency of light bulbs\n\t4 Discussion\n\t5 See also\n\t6 References\n\t7 External links\n\n\n\n\n\nEfficiency of typical electrical devices[edit]\n\nEfficiency should not be confused with effectiveness: a system that wastes most of its input power but produces exactly what it is meant to is effective but not efficient. The term \"efficiency\" makes sense only in reference to the wanted effect. A light bulb, for example, might have 2% efficiency at emitting light yet still be 98% efficient at heating a room (In practice it is nearly 100% efficient at heating a room because the light energy will also be converted to heat eventually, apart from the small fraction that leaves through the windows). An electronic amplifier that delivers 10 watts of power to its load (e.g., a loudspeaker), while drawing 20 watts of power from a power source is 50% efficient. (10/20 \u00d7 100 = 50%)\n\n\n\tElectric kettle: more than 90%[citation needed] (comparatively little heat energy is lost during the 2 to 3 minutes a kettle takes to boil water).\n\tA premium efficiency electric motor: more than 90% (see Main Article: Premium efficiency).\n\tA large power transformer used in the electrical grid may have efficiency of more than 99%. Early 19th century transformers were much less efficient, wasting up to a third of the energy passing through them.[citation needed]\n\tA steam power plant used to generate electricity may have 30-40% efficiency.[citation needed]\n\n\nEfficiency of devices at point of maximum power transfer ...[edit]\n\nAs a result of the maximum power theorem, devices transfer maximum power to a load when running at 50% electrical efficiency. This occurs when the load resistance (of the device in question) is equal to the internal Thevenin equivalent resistance of the power source.  This is valid only for non-reactive source and load impedances.\n\n\nEfficiency of light bulbs[edit]\n\nFurther information: Luminous efficacy\n\n  \nDiagram of efficiency for various types of lamps\n\n\n\n\tIncandescent light bulb: about 2%.\n\tCompact fluorescent lamp: about 7\u20139%.\n\tWhite light-emitting diode (LED) about 4\u201318%.\n\n\nDiscussion[edit]\n\n\t\n\tThis section does not cite any sources.

Inefficiency may require weighing the cost either of the wasted energy, or of the required power supply, against the cost of attaining greater efficiency. Efficiency can usually be improved by choosing different components or by redesigning the system. Inefficiency probably produces extra heat within the system, which must be removed if it is to remain within its operating temperature range.  In a climate-controlled environment, like a home or office, heat generated by appliances may reduce heating costs or increase air conditioning costs.\n\n\nSee also[edit]\n\n\tAntenna efficiency\n\tList of electronics topics\n\tMaximum Power Theorem\n\tThermal efficiency\n\tMechanical efficiency\n\tPerformance per watt\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n\n\nExternal links[edit]\n\n\tConversion: Energy efficiency in percent of passive loudspeakers to sensitivity in dB per watt and meter\n\t4E - International Energy Agency Implementing Agreement to promote energy efficiency and standards for electrical products worldwide\n\tLoad Power Sources for Peak Efficiency, EDN 1979 October 5\n\tSystem for the Peak Efficiency detection, IEEE TPEL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\tRetrieved from \"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Electrical_efficiency&oldid=912051954\"\n\n\t\t\n\t\tCategories: \tElectrical engineering\n\tEnergy economics\n\n\nHidden categories: \tArticles needing additional references from October 2008\n\tAll articles needing additional references\n\tAll articles with unsourced statements\n\tArticles with unsourced statements from October 2014\n\tArticles with unsourced statements from August 2019\n\tArticles needing additional references from October 2012\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tNavigation menu\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPersonal tools\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNot logged in\n\tTalk\n\tContributions\n\tCreate account\n\tLog in\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNamespaces\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tArticle\n\tTalk\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVariants\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tViews\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead\n\tEdit\n\tView history\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMore\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSearch\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tNavigation\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMain page\n\tContents\n\tFeatured content\n\tCurrent events\n\tRandom article\n\tDonate to Wikipedia\n\tWikipedia store\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tInteraction\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHelp\n\tAbout Wikipedia\n\tCommunity portal\n\tRecent changes\n\tContact page\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tTools\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat links here\n\tRelated changes\n\tUpload file\n\tSpecial pages\n\tPermanent link\n\tPage information\n\tWikidata item\n\tCite this page\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tPrint/export\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCreate a book\n\tDownload as PDF\n\tPrintable version\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tLanguages\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629\n\tDeutsch\n\tEspa\u00f1ol\n\tItaliano\n\t\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439\n\tT\u00fcrk\u00e7e\n\n\n\t\t\t\tEdit links\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This page was last edited on 22 August 2019, at 22:53\u00a0(UTC).\n\tText is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License;\nadditional terms may apply.

Established in 1975 and headquartered in Paris, ESA has a worldwide staff of about 2,200 in 2018[7] and an annual budget of about \u20ac5.72 billion (~US$6.43 billion) in 2019.[3]\n\nESA's space flight programme includes human spaceflight (mainly through participation in the International Space Station program); the launch and operation of unmanned exploration missions to other planets and the Moon; Earth observation, science and telecommunication; designing launch vehicles; and maintaining a major spaceport, the Guiana Space Centre at Kourou, French Guiana. The main European launch vehicle Ariane 5 is operated through Arianespace with ESA sharing in the costs of launching and further developing this launch vehicle. The agency is also working with NASA to manufacture the Orion Spacecraft service module, that will fly on the Space Launch System.[8][9]\n\nThe agency's facilities are distributed among the following centres:\n\n\n\tESA science missions are based at ESTEC in Noordwijk, Netherlands;\n\tEarth Observation missions at ESA Centre for Earth Observation in Frascati, Italy;\n\tESA Mission Control (ESOC) is in Darmstadt, Germany;\n\tthe European Astronaut Centre (EAC) that trains astronauts for future missions is situated in Cologne, Germany;\n\tthe European Centre for Space Applications and Telecommunications (ECSAT), a research institute created in 2009, is located in Harwell, England;\n\tand the European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC) is located in Villanueva de la Ca\u00f1ada, Madrid, Spain.\n\n\nThe European Space Agency Science Programme is a long-term programme of space science and space exploration missions.\n\n\nContents\n\n\n\t1 History\n\t1.1 Foundation\n\t1.2 Later activities\n\n\n\n\t2 Mission\n\t3 Activities and programmes\n\t3.1 Activities\n\t3.2 Programmes\n\t3.2.1 Mandatory\n\t3.2.2 Optional\n\t3.2.3 ESA_LAB@\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t4 Member states, funding and budget\n\t4.1 Membership and contribution to ESA\n\t4.2 Non-full member states\n\t4.2.1 Slovenia\n\t4.2.2 Canada\n\n\n\n\t4.3 Budget appropriation and allocation\n\t4.4 Enlargement\n\t4.5 EU and the European Space Agency\n\n\n\n\t5 Launch vehicle fleet\n\t5.1 Ariane 5\n\t5.2 Soyuz\n\t5.3 Vega\n\t5.4 Ariane launch vehicle development funding\n\n\n\n\t6 Human space flight\n\t6.1 History\n\t6.2 Astronaut names\n\t6.3 Crew vehicles\n\n\n\n\t7 Cooperation with other countries and organisations\n\t7.1 European Union\n\t7.2 National space organisations of member states\n\t7.3 NASA\n\t7.4 Cooperation with other space agencies\n\t7.5 International Space Station\n\t7.6 Languages\n\t7.7 Facilities\n\n\n\n\t8 ESA and the EU institutions\n\t8.1 Guaranteeing European access to space\n\n\n\n\t9 Incidents\n\t10 See also\n\t10.1 European Union matters\n\n\n\n\t11 References\n\t12 Further reading\n\t13 External links\n\n\n\n\n\nHistory[edit]\n\n\t\n\tThis section needs additional citations for verification.

ESTEC was the main technical centre of ESRO and remains so for the successor organisation, ESA.\n\n\n\nAfter World War II, many European scientists left Western Europe in order to work with the United States. Although the 1950s boom made it possible for Western European countries to invest in research and specifically in space-related activities, Western European scientists realised solely national projects would not be able to compete with the two main superpowers. In 1958, only months after the Sputnik shock, Edoardo Amaldi (Italy) and Pierre Auger (France), two prominent members of the Western European scientific community, met to discuss the foundation of a common Western European space agency. The meeting was attended by scientific representatives from eight countries, including Harrie Massey (United Kingdom).\n\nThe Western European nations decided to have two agencies: one concerned with developing a launch system, ELDO (European Launch Development Organization), and the other the precursor of the European Space Agency, ESRO (European Space Research Organisation). The latter was established on 20 March 1964 by an agreement signed on 14 June 1962. From 1968 to 1972, ESRO launched seven research satellites.\n\nESA in its current form was founded with the ESA Convention in 1975, when ESRO was merged with ELDO. ESA had ten founding member states: Belgium, Denmark, France, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.[10] These signed the ESA Convention in 1975 and deposited the instruments of ratification by 1980, when the convention came into force. During this interval the agency functioned in a de facto fashion. ESA launched its first major scientific mission in 1975, Cos-B, a space probe monitoring gamma-ray emissions in the universe, which was first worked on by ESRO.\n\n\nLater activities[edit]\n\n  \nMock-up of the Ariane 1\n\n\n\nESA collaborated with NASA on the International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE), the world's first high-orbit telescope, which was launched in 1978 and operated successfully for 18 years. A number of successful Earth-orbit projects followed, and in 1986 ESA began Giotto, its first deep-space mission, to study the comets Halley and Grigg\u2013Skjellerup. Hipparcos, a star-mapping mission, was launched in 1989 and in the 1990s SOHO, Ulysses and the Hubble Space Telescope were all jointly carried out with NASA. Later scientific missions in cooperation with NASA include the Cassini\u2013Huygens space probe, to which ESA contributed by building the Titan landing module Huygens.\n\nAs the successor of ELDO, ESA has also constructed rockets for scientific and commercial payloads. Ariane 1, launched in 1979, carried mostly commercial payloads into orbit from 1984 onward. The next two versions of the Ariane rocket were intermediate stages in the development of a more advanced launch system, the Ariane 4, which operated between 1988 and 2003 and established ESA as the world leader[11] in commercial space launches in the 1990s. Although the succeeding Ariane 5 experienced a failure on its first flight, it has since firmly established itself within the heavily competitive commercial space launch market with 82 successful launches until 2018. The successor launch vehicle of Ariane 5, the Ariane 6, is under development and is envisioned to enter service in the 2020s.\n\nThe beginning of the new millennium saw ESA become, along with agencies like NASA, JAXA, ISRO, the CSA and Roscosmos, one of the major participants in scientific space research. Although ESA had relied on co-operation with NASA in previous decades, especially the 1990s, changed circumstances (such as tough legal restrictions on information sharing by the United States military) led to decisions to rely more on itself and on co-operation with Russia. A 2011 press issue thus stated:[12]\n\n\nRussia is ESA's first partner in its efforts to ensure long-term access to space. There is a framework agreement between ESA and the government of the Russian Federation on cooperation and partnership in the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes, and cooperation is already underway in two different areas of launcher activity that will bring benefits to both partners.\n\n\n\nNotable ESA programs include SMART-1, a probe testing cutting-edge space propulsion technology, the Mars Express and Venus Express missions, as well as the development of the Ariane 5 rocket and its role in the ISS partnership. ESA maintains its scientific and research projects mainly for astronomy-space missions such as Corot, launched on 27 December 2006, a milestone in the search for exoplanets.\n\nOn 21 January 2019, ArianeGroup and Arianespace announced a one-year contract with ESA to study and prepare for a mission to mine the moon for lunar regolith.[13]\n\n\nMission[edit]\n\nThe treaty establishing the European Space Agency reads:[14]\n\n\n\nESA's purpose shall be to provide for, and to promote, for exclusively peaceful purposes, cooperation among the European States in space research and technology and their space applications, with a view to their being used for scientific purposes and for operational space applications systems\n\n\n\nESA is responsible for setting a unified space and related industrial policy, recommending space objectives to the member states, and integrating national programs like satellite development, into the European program as much as possible.[14]\n\nJean-Jacques Dordain \u2013 ESA's Director General (2003-2015) \u2013 outlined the European Space Agency's mission in a 2003 interview:[15]\n\n\n\nToday space activities have pursued the benefit of citizens, and citizens are asking for a better quality of life on Earth. They want greater security and economic wealth, but they also want to pursue their dreams, to increase their knowledge, and they want younger people to be attracted to the pursuit of science and technology.\n\nI think that space can do all of this: it can produce a higher quality of life, better security, more economic wealth, and also fulfill our citizens' dreams and thirst for knowledge, and attract the young generation. This is the reason space exploration is an integral part of overall space activities. It has always been so, and it will be even more important in the future.\n\n\n\n\nActivities and programmes[edit]\n\nMain article: List of European Space Agency programs and missions\n\nESA describes its work in two overlapping ways: \n\n\n\tFor the general public, the various fields of work are described as Activities.\n\tBudgets are organized as Programmes (British spelling retained because it is a term of official documents).

These nations were also members of either ELDO or ESRO.[34]\n\n\t^ a b c d e f g h i Acceded members became ESA member states upon signing an accession agreement.[35][36][37][38][39][40][41] \n\n\t^ Canada is a Cooperating State of ESA.[42][43]\n\n\t^ Framework Agreement establishing the legal basis for cooperation between ESA and the European Union came into force in May 2004.\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-full member states[edit]\n\nSlovenia[edit]\n\nCurrently the only associated member state is Slovenia.[44] Previously associated members were Austria, Norway and Finland, all of which later joined ESA as full members.\n\n\nCanada[edit]\n\nSince 1 January 1979, Canada has had the special status of a Cooperating State within ESA. By virtue of this accord, the Canadian Space Agency takes part in ESA's deliberative bodies and decision-making and also in ESA's programmes and activities. Canadian firms can bid for and receive contracts to work on programmes. The accord has a provision ensuring a fair industrial return to Canada.[46] The most recent Cooperation Agreement was signed on 2010-12-15 with a term extending to 2020.[47][48] For 2014, Canada's annual assessed contribution to the ESA general budget was \u20ac6,059,449 (CAD$8,559,050).[49] For 2017, Canada has increased its annual contribution to \u20ac21,600,000 (CAD$30,000,000).[50]\n\n\nBudget appropriation and allocation[edit]\n\n  \nEuropean Space Agency 2016 budget by domain out of a total budget is 5250M\u20ac.\n\n\n\nESA is funded from annual contributions by national governments as well as from an annual contribution by the European Union (EU).[51]\n\nThe budget of ESA was \u20ac5.250 billion in 2016.[52] Every 3\u20134 years, ESA member states agree on a budget plan for several years at an ESA member states conference. This plan can be amended in future years, however provides the major guideline for ESA for several years.[citation needed] The 2016 budget allocations for major areas of ESA activity are shown in the chart on the right.[52]\n\nCountries typically have their own space programmes that differ in how they operate organisationally and financially with ESA. For example, the French space agency CNES has a total budget of \u20ac2015 million, of which \u20ac755 million is paid as direct financial contribution to ESA.[53] Several space-related projects are joint projects between national space agencies and ESA (e.g. COROT). Also, ESA is not the only European governmental space organisation (for example European Union Satellite Centre).\n\n\nEnlargement[edit]\n\nSee also: Enlargement of the European Space Agency\n\nAfter the decision of the ESA Council of 21/22 March 2001, the procedure for accession of the European states was detailed as described the document titled \"The Plan for European Co-operating States (PECS)\".[54]\nNations that want to become a full member of ESA do so in 3 stages. First a Cooperation Agreement is signed between the country and ESA. In this stage, the country has very limited financial responsibilities. If a country wants to co-operate more fully with ESA, it signs a European Cooperating State (ECS) Agreement. The ECS Agreement makes companies based in the country eligible for participation in ESA procurements. The country can also participate in all ESA programmes, except for the Basic Technology Research Programme. While the financial contribution of the country concerned increases, it is still much lower than that of a full member state. The agreement is normally followed by a Plan For European Cooperating State (or PECS Charter). This is a 5-year programme of basic research and development activities aimed at improving the nation's space industry capacity. At the end of the 5-year period, the country can either begin negotiations to become a full member state or an associated state or sign a new PECS Charter.[55] Many countries, most of which joined the EU in both 2004 and 2007, have started to co-operate with ESA on various levels:\n\n\n\tApplicant state\n\tEU membership\n\tCooperation Agreement\n\tECS Agreement\n\tPECS Charter(s)\n\tNational Programme\n\n\t\u00a0Turkey\tNo\t15 July 2004[56]\t\t\tTUSA\n\n\t\u00a0Ukraine\tNo\t25 January 2008[57]\t\t\tSSAU\n\n\t\u00a0Slovenia\t2004\t28 May 2008[58]\t22 January 2010[59]\t30 November 2010[60]\tthrough MoHEST\n\n\t\u00a0Latvia\t2004\t23 July 2009[61]\t19 March 2013[62]\t30 January 2015[63]\tthrough MoES\n\n\t\u00a0Cyprus\t2004\t27 August 2009[64]\t6 July 2016[65]\t\tthrough MoCW\n\n\t\u00a0Slovakia\t2004\t28 April 2010[66]\t16 February 2015[67]\t\tthrough MoE\n\n\t\u00a0Lithuania\t2004\t7 October 2010[68]\t10 October 2014[69]\t\tLSA[70][71]\n\n\t\u00a0Israel\tNo\t30 January 2011[72]\t\t\tISA\n\n\t\u00a0Malta\t2004\t20 February 2012[73]\t\t\tMCST[74]\n\n\t\u00a0Bulgaria\t2007\t\t8 April 2015[75]\t4 February 2016[76]\tSRTI\n\n\t\u00a0Croatia\n\t2013\n\t19 February 2018[77]\n\t\n\t\n\tthrough MoSE\n\n\n\nDuring the Ministerial Meeting in December 2014, ESA ministers approved a resolution calling for discussions to begin with Israel, Australia and South Africa on future association agreements. The ministers noted that \u201cconcrete cooperation is at an advanced stage\u201d with these nations and that \u201cprospects for mutual benefits are existing\u201d.[78]\n\nA separate space exploration strategy resolution calls for further co-operation with the United States, Russia and China on \"LEO exploration, including a continuation of ISS cooperation and the development of a robust plan for the coordinated use of space transportation vehicles and systems for exploration purposes, participation in robotic missions for the exploration of the Moon, the robotic exploration of Mars, leading to a broad Mars Sample Return mission in which Europe should be involved as a full partner, and human missions beyond LEO in the longer term.\"[78]\n\n\nEU and the European Space Agency[edit]\n\nThe political perspective of the European Union (EU) was to make ESA an agency of the EU by 2014,[79] although this date was not met. The EU is already the largest single donor to ESA's budget and non-ESA EU states are observers at ESA.\n\n\nLaunch vehicle fleet[edit]\n\nESA has a fleet of different launch vehicles in service with which it competes in all sectors of the launch market. ESA's fleet consists of three major rocket designs: Ariane 5, Soyuz-2 and Vega. Rocket launches are carried out by Arianespace, which has 23 shareholders representing the industry that manufactures the Ariane 5 as well as CNES, at ESA's Guiana Space Centre. Because many communication satellites have equatorial orbits, launches from French Guiana are able to take larger payloads into space than from spaceports at higher latitudes. In addition, equatorial launches give spacecraft an extra 'push' of nearly 500\u00a0m/s due to the higher rotational velocity of the Earth at the equator compared to near the Earth's poles where rotational velocity approaches zero.\n\n\nAriane 5[edit]\n\nMain article: Ariane 5\n\n  \nAriane 5 ECA transported to the ELA-3 launch pad\n\n\n\nThe Ariane 5 rocket is ESA's primary launcher. It has been in service since 1997 and replaced Ariane 4. Two different variants are currently in use. The heaviest and most used version, the Ariane 5 ECA, delivers two communications satellites of up to 10 tonnes into GTO. It failed during its first test flight in 2002, but has since made 82 consecutive successful flights until a partial failure in January 2018. The other version, Ariane 5 ES, was used to launch the Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) to the International Space Station (ISS) and will be used to launch four Galileo navigational satellites at a time.[80][81]\n\nIn November 2012, ESA agreed to build an upgraded variant called Ariane 5 ME (Mid-life Evolution) which would increase payload capacity to 11.5 tonnes to GTO and feature a restartable second stage to allow more complex missions. Ariane 5 ME was scheduled to fly in 2018,[82] but the whole project was scrapped in favor of Ariane 6, planned to replace Ariane 5 in the 2020s.\n\nESA's Ariane 1, 2, 3 and 4 launchers (the last of which was ESA's long-time workhorse) have been retired.\n\n\nSoyuz[edit]\n\nMain article: Soyuz at the Guiana Space Centre\n\n  \nSoyuz Launch Complex\n\n\n\nSoyuz-2 (also called the Soyuz-ST or Soyuz-STK) is a Russian medium payload launcher (ca. 3 metric tons to GTO) which was brought into ESA service in October 2011.[83][84] ESA entered into a \u20ac340 million joint venture with the Russian Federal Space Agency over the use of the Soyuz launcher.[12] Under the agreement, the Russian agency manufactures Soyuz rocket parts for ESA, which are then shipped to French Guiana for assembly.\n\nESA benefits because it gains a medium payload launcher, complementing its fleet while saving on development costs. In addition, the Soyuz rocket\u2014which has been the Russian's space launch workhorse for some 40 years\u2014is proven technology with a very good safety record. Russia benefits in that it gets access to the Kourou launch site. Due to its proximity to the equator, launching from Kourou rather than Baikonur nearly doubles Soyuz's payload to GTO (3.0 tonnes vs. 1.7 tonnes).\n\nSoyuz first launched from Kourou on 21 October 2011, and successfully placed two Galileo satellites into orbit 23,222 kilometres above Earth.[83]\n\n\nVega[edit]\n\n  \nVega rocket\n\n\n\nMain article: Vega (rocket)\n\nVega is ESA's carrier for small satellites. Developed by seven ESA members led by Italy, it is capable of carrying a payload with a mass of between 300 and 1500\u00a0kg to an altitude of 700\u00a0km, for low polar orbit. Its maiden launch from Kourou was on 13 February 2012.[85] Vega began full commercial exploitation in December 2015 [86]\n\nThe rocket has three solid propulsion stages and a liquid propulsion upper stage (the AVUM) for accurate orbital insertion and the ability to place multiple payloads into different orbits.[87][88]\n\n\nAriane launch vehicle development funding[edit]\n\nHistorically, the Ariane family rockets have been funded primarily \"with money contributed by ESA governments seeking to participate in the program rather than through competitive industry bids. This [has meant that] governments commit multiyear funding to the development with the expectation of a roughly 90% return on investment in the form of industrial workshare.\"  ESA is proposing changes to this scheme by moving to competitive bids for the development of the Ariane 6.[89]\n\n\nHuman space flight[edit]\n\nHistory[edit]\n\n  \nUlf Merbold became the first ESA astronaut to fly into space.\n\n\n\nAt the time ESA was formed, its main goals did not encompass human space flight; rather it considered itself to be primarily a scientific research organisation for unmanned space exploration in contrast to its American and Soviet counterparts. It is therefore not surprising that the first non-Soviet European in space was not an ESA astronaut on a European space craft; it was Czechoslovak Vladim\u00edr Remek who in 1978 became the first non-Soviet or American in space (the first man in space being Yuri Gagarin of the Soviet Union) \u2013 on a Soviet Soyuz spacecraft, followed by the Pole Miros\u0142aw Hermaszewski and East German Sigmund J\u00e4hn in the same year. This Soviet co-operation programme, known as Intercosmos, primarily involved the participation of Eastern bloc countries. In 1982, however, Jean-Loup Chr\u00e9tien became the first non-Communist Bloc astronaut on a flight to the Soviet Salyut 7 space station.\n\nBecause Chr\u00e9tien did not officially fly into space as an ESA astronaut, but rather as a member of the French CNES astronaut corps, the German Ulf Merbold is considered the first ESA astronaut to fly into space. He participated in the STS-9 Space Shuttle mission that included the first use of the European-built Spacelab in 1983. STS-9 marked the beginning of an extensive ESA/NASA joint partnership that included dozens of space flights of ESA astronauts in the following years. Some of these missions with Spacelab were fully funded and organizationally and scientifically controlled by ESA (such as two missions by Germany and one by Japan) with European astronauts as full crew members rather than guests on board. Beside paying for Spacelab flights and seats on the shuttles, ESA continued its human space flight co-operation with the Soviet Union and later Russia, including numerous visits to Mir.\n\nDuring the latter half of the 1980s, European human space flights changed from being the exception to routine and therefore, in 1990, the European Astronaut Centre in Cologne, Germany was established. It selects and trains prospective astronauts and is responsible for the co-ordination with international partners, especially with regard to the International Space Station. As of 2006, the ESA astronaut corps officially included twelve members, including nationals from most large European countries except the United Kingdom.\n\nIn the summer of 2008, ESA started to recruit new astronauts so that final selection would be due in spring 2009. Almost 10,000 people registered as astronaut candidates before registration ended in June 2008. 8,413 fulfilled the initial application criteria. Of the applicants, 918 were chosen to take part in the first stage of psychological testing, which narrowed down the field to 192. After two-stage psychological tests and medical evaluation in early 2009, as well as formal interviews, six new members of the European Astronaut Corps were selected - five men and one woman.[90]\n\n\nAstronaut names[edit]\n\nSee also: European Astronaut Corps\n\nThe astronauts of the European Space Agency are:\n\n\n\n\t Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Clervoy[note 1]\n\t   Samantha Cristoforetti[note 2][note 3]\n\t Frank De Winne[note 3]\n\t   Pedro Duque[note 3]\n\t Reinhold Ewald[note 1]\n\t L\u00e9opold Eyharts[note 1][note 3]\n\t Alexander Gerst[note 2][note 3]\n\t   Umberto Guidoni[note 4][note 3]\n\t Christer Fuglesang[note 3]\n\t Andr\u00e9 Kuipers[note 3]\n\t Matthias Maurer[note 2]\n\t Andreas Mogensen[note 2]\n\t Paolo Nespoli[note 3]\n\t Claude Nicollier[note 4]\n\t Luca Parmitano[note 2][note 3]\n\t Timothy Peake[note 2][note 3]\n\t Philippe Perrin[note 4][note 3]\n\t   Thomas Pesquet[note 2]\n\t Thomas Reiter[note 1][note 3]\n\t Hans Schlegel[note 3]\n\t Gerhard Thiele[note 4]\n\t Michel Tognini[note 4][note 1]\n\t Roberto Vittori[note 3]\n\n\n\n\n\n\t^ a b c d e have visited Mir\n\n\t^ a b c d e f g 2009 selection\n\n\t^ a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o have visited the International Space Station\n\n\t^ a b c d e now retired\n\n\n\n\n\nCrew vehicles[edit]\n\nIn the 1980s, France pressed for an independent European crew launch vehicle. Around 1978 it was decided to pursue a reusable spacecraft model and starting in November 1987 a project to create a mini-shuttle by the name of Hermes was introduced. The craft was comparable to early proposals for the Space Shuttle and consisted of a small reusable spaceship that would carry 3 to 5 astronauts and 3 to 4 metric tons of payload for scientific experiments. With a total maximum weight of 21 metric tons it would have been launched on the Ariane 5 rocket, which was being developed at that time. It was planned solely for use in low Earth orbit space flights. The planning and pre-development phase concluded in 1991; the production phase was never fully implemented because at that time the political landscape had changed significantly. With the fall of the Soviet Union ESA looked forward to co-operation with Russia to build a next-generation space vehicle. Thus the Hermes programme was cancelled in 1995 after about 3 billion dollars had been spent. The Columbus space station programme had a similar fate.\n\nIn the 21st century, ESA started new programmes in order to create its own crew vehicles, most notable among its various projects and proposals is Hopper, whose prototype by EADS, called Phoenix, has already been tested. While projects such as Hopper are neither concrete nor to be realised within the next decade, other possibilities for human spaceflight in co-operation with the Russian Space Agency have emerged. Following talks with the Russian Space Agency in 2004 and June 2005,[95] a co-operation between ESA and the Russian Space Agency was announced to jointly work on the Russian-designed Kliper, a reusable spacecraft that would be available for space travel beyond LEO (e.g. the moon or even Mars). It was speculated that Europe would finance part of it. A \u20ac50 million participation study for Kliper, which was expected to be approved in December 2005, was finally not approved by the ESA member states. The Russian state tender for the project was subsequently cancelled in 2006.\n\nIn June 2006, ESA member states granted 15 million to the Crew Space Transportation System (CSTS) study, a two-year study to design a spacecraft capable of going beyond Low-Earth orbit based on the current Soyuz design. This project was pursued with Roskosmos instead of the cancelled Kliper proposal. A decision on the actual implementation and construction of the CSTS spacecraft was contemplated for 2008.\nIn mid-2009 EADS Astrium was awarded a \u20ac21 million study into designing a crew vehicle based on the European ATV which is believed to now be the basis of the Advanced Crew Transportation System design.[96]\n\nIn November 2012, ESA decided to join NASA's Orion programme. The ATV would form the basis of a propulsion unit for NASA's new manned spacecraft. ESA may also seek to work with NASA on Orion's launch system as well in order to secure a seat on the spacecraft for its own astronauts.[97]\n\nIn September 2014, ESA signed an agreement with Sierra Nevada Corporation for co-operation in Dream Chaser project. Further studies on the Dream Chaser for European Utilization or DC4EU project were funded, including the feasibility of launching a Europeanized Dream Chaser onboard Ariane 5.[98][99]\n\n\nCooperation with other countries and organisations[edit]\n\nESA has signed co-operation agreements with the following states that currently neither plan to integrate as tightly with ESA institutions as Canada, nor envision future membership of ESA: Argentina,[100] Brazil,[101] China,[102] India[103] (for the Chandrayan mission), Russia[104] and Turkey.[105]\n\nAdditionally, ESA has joint projects with the European Union, NASA of the United States and is participating in the International Space Station together with the United States (NASA), Russia and Japan (JAXA).\n\n\nEuropean Union[edit]\n\n  \n\u00a0\u00a0ESA and EU member states\n\u00a0\u00a0ESA-only members\n\u00a0\u00a0EU-only members\n\n\n\n\nESA is not an agency or body of the European Union (EU), and has non-EU countries (Norway, and Switzerland) as members. There are however ties between the two, with various agreements in place and being worked on, to define the legal status of ESA with regard to the EU.[106]\n\nThere are common goals between ESA and the EU. ESA has an EU liaison office in Brussels. On certain projects, the EU and ESA co-operate, such as the upcoming Galileo satellite navigation system. Space policy has since December 2009 been an area for voting in the European Council. Under the European Space Policy of 2007, the EU, ESA and its Member States committed themselves to increasing co-ordination of their activities and programmes and to organising their respective roles relating to space.[107]\n\nThe Lisbon Treaty of 2009 reinforces the case for space in Europe and strengthens the role of ESA as an R&D space agency. Article 189 of the Treaty gives the EU a mandate to elaborate a European space policy and take related measures, and provides that the EU should establish appropriate relations with ESA.\n\nFormer Italian astronaut Umberto Guidoni, during his tenure as a Member of the European Parliament from 2004 to 2009, stressed the importance of the European Union as a driving force for space exploration, \"since other players are coming up such as India and China it is becoming ever more important that Europeans can have an independent access to space. We have to invest more into space research and technology in order to have an industry capable of competing with other international players.\"[108]\n\nThe first EU-ESA International Conference on Human Space Exploration took place in Prague on 22 and 23 October 2009.[109] A road map which would lead to a common vision and strategic planning in the area of space exploration was discussed. Ministers from all 29 EU and ESA members as well as members of parliament were in attendance.[110]\n\n\nNational space organisations of member states[edit]\n\n\tThe Centre National d'\u00c9tudes Spatiales (CNES) (National Centre for Space Study) is the French government space agency (administratively, a \"public establishment of industrial and commercial character\"). Its headquarters are in central Paris. CNES is the main participant on the Ariane project. Indeed, CNES designed and tested all Ariane family rockets (mainly from its centre in \u00c9vry near Paris)\n\tThe UK Space Agency is a partnership of the UK government departments which are active in space. Through the UK Space Agency, the partners provide delegates to represent the UK on the various ESA governing bodies. Each partner funds its own programme.\n\tThe Italian Space Agency (Agenzia Spaziale Italiana or ASI) was founded in 1988 to promote, co-ordinate and conduct space activities in Italy. Operating under the Ministry of the Universities and of Scientific and Technological Research, the agency cooperates with numerous entities active in space technology and with the president of the Council of Ministers. Internationally, the ASI provides Italy's delegation to the Council of the European Space Agency and to its subordinate bodies.\n\tThe German Aerospace Center (DLR) (German: Deutsches Zentrum f\u00fcr Luft- und Raumfahrt e. V.) is the national research centre for aviation and space flight of the Federal Republic of Germany and of other member states in the Helmholtz Association. Its extensive research and development projects are included in national and international cooperative programmes. In addition to its research projects, the centre is the assigned space agency of Germany bestowing headquarters of German space flight activities and its associates.\n\tThe Instituto Nacional de T\u00e9cnica Aeroespacial (INTA) (National Institute for Aerospace Technique) is a Public Research Organization specialised in aerospace research and technology development in Spain. Among other functions, it serves as a platform for space research and acts as a significant testing facility for the aeronautic and space sector in the country.\n\n\nNASA[edit]\n\nESA has a long history of collaboration with NASA. Since ESA's astronaut corps was formed, the Space Shuttle has been the primary launch vehicle used by ESA's astronauts to get into space through partnership programmes with NASA. In the 1980s and 1990s, the Spacelab programme was an ESA-NASA joint research programme that had ESA develop and manufacture orbital labs for the Space Shuttle for several flights on which ESA participate with astronauts in experiments.\n\nIn robotic science mission and exploration missions, NASA has been ESA's main partner. Cassini\u2013Huygens was a joint NASA-ESA mission, along with the Infrared Space Observatory, INTEGRAL, SOHO, and others. Also, the Hubble Space Telescope is a joint project of NASA and ESA. Future ESA-NASA joint projects include the James Webb Space Telescope and the proposed Laser Interferometer Space Antenna.[citation needed] NASA has committed to provide support to ESA's proposed MarcoPolo-R mission to return an asteroid sample to Earth for further analysis.[citation needed] NASA and ESA will also likely join together for a Mars Sample Return Mission.[111]\n\n\nCooperation with other space agencies[edit]\n\nSince China has started to invest more money into space activities, the Chinese Space Agency has sought international partnerships. ESA is, beside the Russian Space Agency, one of its most important partners. Two space agencies cooperated in the development of the Double Star Mission.[112] In 2017, ESA sent two astronauts to China for two weeks sea survival training with Chinese astronauts in Yantai, Shandong.[113]\n\nESA entered into a major joint venture with Russia in the form of the CSTS, the preparation of French Guiana spaceport for launches of Soyuz-2 rockets and other projects. With India, ESA agreed to send instruments into space aboard the ISRO's Chandrayaan-1 in 2008.[114] ESA is also co-operating with Japan, the most notable current project in collaboration with JAXA is the BepiColombo mission to Mercury.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at an air show near Moscow in August 2011, ESA head Jean-Jacques Dordain said ESA and Russia's Roskosmos space agency would \"carry out the first flight to Mars together.\"[115]\n\n\nInternational Space Station[edit]\n\nSee also: European contribution to the International Space Station\n\n  \nISS module Columbus at Kennedy Space Center's Space Station Processing Facility\n\n\n\nWith regard to the International Space Station (ISS) ESA is not represented by all of its member states:[116] 10 of the 21 ESA member states currently participate in the project: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. Austria, Finland and Ireland chose not to participate, because of lack of interest or concerns about the expense of the project. The United Kingdom withdrew from the preliminary agreement because of concerns about the expense of the project. Portugal, Luxembourg, Greece, the Czech Republic, Romania and Poland joined ESA after the agreement had been signed. ESA is taking part in the construction and operation of the ISS with contributions such as Columbus, a science laboratory module that was brought into orbit by NASA's STS-122 Space Shuttle mission and the Cupola observatory module that was completed in July 2005 by Alenia Spazio for ESA. The current estimates for the ISS are approaching \u20ac100 billion in total (development, construction and 10 years of maintaining the station) of which ESA has committed to paying \u20ac8 billion.[117] About 90% of the costs of ESA's ISS share will be contributed by Germany (41%), France (28%) and Italy (20%). German ESA astronaut Thomas Reiter was the first long-term ISS crew member.\n\nESA has developed the Automated Transfer Vehicle for ISS resupply. Each ATV has a cargo capacity of 7,667 kilograms (16,903\u00a0lb).[118] The first ATV, Jules Verne, was launched on 9 March 2008 and on 3 April 2008 successfully docked with the ISS. This manoeuvre, considered a major technical feat, involved using automated systems to allow the ATV to track the ISS, moving at 27,000\u00a0km/h, and attach itself with an accuracy of 2\u00a0cm.\n\nAs of 2013, the spacecraft establishing supply links to the ISS are the Russian Progress and Soyuz, European ATV, Japanese Kounotori (HTV), and the USA COTS program vehicles Dragon and Cygnus.\n\nEuropean Life and Physical Sciences research on board the International Space Station (ISS) is mainly based on the European Programme for Life and Physical Sciences in Space programme that was initiated in 2001.\n\n\nLanguages[edit]\n\nAccording to Annex 1, Resolution No. 8 of the ESA Convention and Council Rules of Procedure,[4] English, French and German may be used in all meetings of the Agency, with interpretation provided into these three languages. All official documents are available in English and French with all documents concerning the ESA Council being available in German as well.\n\n\nFacilities[edit]\n\n  \nESA Mission Control at ESOC in Darmstadt, Germany\n\n\n\n\tESA Headquarters (HQ), Paris, France\n\tEuropean Space Operations Centre (ESOC), Darmstadt, Germany\n\tEuropean Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC), Noordwijk, The Netherlands\n\tEuropean Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC), Madrid, Spain[119]\n\tEuropean Centre for Space Applications and Telecommunications (ECSAT), Oxfordshire, United Kingdom[120]\n\tEuropean Astronaut Centre (EAC), Cologne, Germany\n\tESA Centre for Earth Observation (ESRIN), Frascati, Italy\n\tGuiana Space Centre (CSG), Kourou, French Guiana\n\tEuropean Space Tracking Network (ESTRACK)\n\tEuropean Data Relay System\n\n\nESA and the EU institutions[edit]\n\nThe Flag of Europe is the one to be flown in space during missions (for example it was flown by ESA's Andre Kuipers during Delta mission)\n\nThe Commission is increasingly working together towards common objectives. Some 20 per cent of the funds managed by ESA now originate from the supranational budget of the European Union.\n\nHowever, in recent years the ties between ESA and the European institutions have been reinforced by the increasing role that space plays in supporting Europe's social, political and economic policies.\n\nThe legal basis for the EU/ESA co-operation is provided by a Framework Agreement which entered into force in May 2004. According to this agreement, the European Commission and ESA co-ordinate their actions through the Joint Secretariat, a small team of EC's administrators and ESA executive. The Member States of the two organisations meet at ministerial level in the Space Council, which is a concomitant meeting of the EU and ESA Councils, prepared by Member States representatives in the High-level Space Policy Group (HSPG).\n\nESA maintains a liaison office in Brussels to facilitate relations with the European institutions.\n\n\nGuaranteeing European access to space[edit]\n\nIn May 2007, the 29 European countries expressed their support for the European Space Policy in a resolution of the Space Council, unifying the approach of ESA with those of the European Union and their member states.\n\nPrepared jointly by the European Commission and ESA's Director General, the European Space Policy sets out a basic vision and strategy for the space sector and addresses issues such as security and defence, access to space and exploration.\n\nThrough this resolution, the EU, ESA and their Member States all commit to increasing co-ordination of their activities and programmes and their respective roles relating to space.[121]\n\n\nIncidents[edit]\n\nOn 3 August 1984 ESA's Paris headquarters were severely damaged and six people were hurt when a bomb exploded, planted by the far-left armed Action Directe group.[122]\n\nOn 14 December 2015, hackers from Anonymous breached ESA's subdomains and leaked thousands of login credentials.[123]\n\n\nSee also[edit]\n\n\n\tSpaceflight portal\n\n\n\n\tList of government space agencies\n\tList of directors general of the European Space Agency\n\tList of projects of the European Space Agency\n\tEuropean Launcher Development Organisation (ELDO)\n\tEuropean Space Research Organisation (ESRO)\n\tEuropean integration#Space\n\tEurospace\n\n\nEuropean Union matters[edit]\n\n\tAgencies of the European Union\n\tSpace policy of the European Union\n\tEuropean Union Agency for the Space Programme\n\tDirectorate-General for Defence Industry and Space\n\tEnhanced co-operation\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n\t^ \"Languages\".

ESA Director General Jean-Jacques Dordain is aiming to reduce the agency's development and operational costs in a stark departure from past practice: Until now, the Ariane family of rockets has been built largely with money contributed by ESA governments seeking to participate in the program rather than through competitive industry bids. This means governments commit multiyear funding to the development with the expectation of a roughly 90% return on investment in the form of industrial workshare.  But in July, when Dordain presents ESA's member states with industry proposals for building the Ariane 6, he will seek government contributions based on the best value for money, not geographic return on investment.

The Hohmann transfer orbit uses the lowest possible amount of energy in traveling between these orbits.[1][2]\n\nThe term is also used to refer to transfer orbits between different bodies (planets, moons etc.). They are also often used for these situations, but low-energy transfers which take into account the thrust limitations of real engines, and take advantage of the gravity wells of both planets can be more fuel efficient.[3][4][5]\n\nA Hohmann transfer requires that the starting and destination points be at particular locations in their orbits relative to each other.  Space missions using a Hohmann transfer must wait for this required alignment to occur, which opens a so-called launch window.  For a space mission between Earth and Mars, for example, these launch windows occur every 26 months.  A Hohmann transfer orbit also determines a fixed time required to travel between the starting and destination points; for an Earth-Mars journey this travel time is about 9 months.  \n\nThe orbital maneuver to perform the Hohmann transfer uses two engine impulses, one to move a spacecraft onto the transfer orbit and a second to move off it. This maneuver was named after Walter Hohmann, the German scientist who published a description of it in his 1925 book Die Erreichbarkeit der Himmelsk\u00f6rper (The Attainability of Celestial Bodies).[6] Hohmann was influenced in part by the German science fiction author Kurd Lasswitz and his 1897 book Two Planets.\n\n\nContents\n\n\n\t1 Explanation\n\t1.1 Type I and Type II\n\n\n\n\t2 Calculation\n\t3 Example\n\t4 Worst case, maximum delta-v\n\t5 Application to interplanetary travel\n\t6 Hohmann transfer versus low thrust orbits\n\t6.1 Low-thrust transfer\n\t6.2 Interplanetary Transport Network\n\n\n\n\t7 See also\n\t8 References\n\t9 Sources\n\t10 External links\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanation[edit]\n\nThe diagram shows a Hohmann transfer orbit to bring a spacecraft from a lower circular orbit into a higher one. It is one half of an elliptic orbit that touches both the lower circular orbit the spacecraft wishes to leave (green and labeled 1 on diagram) and the higher circular orbit that it wishes to reach (red and labeled 3 on diagram). The transfer (yellow and labeled 2 on diagram) is initiated by firing the spacecraft's engine to accelerate it so that it will follow the elliptical orbit. This adds energy to the spacecraft's orbit. When the spacecraft has reached its destination orbit, its orbital speed (and hence its orbital energy) must be increased again to change the elliptic orbit to the larger circular one.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nDue to the reversibility of orbits, Hohmann transfer orbits also work to bring a spacecraft from a higher orbit into a lower one; in this case, the spacecraft's engine is fired in the opposite direction to its current path, slowing the spacecraft and causing it to drop into the lower-energy elliptical transfer orbit. The engine is then fired again at the lower distance to slow the spacecraft into the lower circular orbit.\n\nThe Hohmann transfer orbit is based on two instantaneous velocity changes. Extra fuel is required to compensate for the fact that the bursts take time; this is minimized by using high-thrust engines to minimize the duration of the bursts.  For transfers in Earth orbit, the two burns are labelled the perigee burn and the apogee burn (or ''apogee kick[7]); more generally, they are labelled periapsis and apoapsis burns.  Alternately, the second burn to circularize the orbit may be referred to as a circularization burn.\n\n\nType I and Type II[edit]\n\nAn ideal Hohmann transfer orbit transfers between two circular orbits in the same plane and traverses exactly 180\u00b0 around the primary.  In the real world, the destination orbit may not be circular, and may not be coplanar with the initial orbit.  Real world transfer orbits may traverse slightly more, or slightly less, than 180\u00b0 around the primary.  An orbit which traverses less than 180\u00b0 around the primary is called a \"Type I\" Hohmann transfer, while an orbit which traverses more than 180\u00b0 is called a \"Type II\" Hohmann transfer.[8][9]\n\n\nCalculation[edit]\n\nFor a small body orbiting another much larger body, such as a satellite orbiting Earth, the total energy of the smaller body is the sum of its kinetic energy and potential energy, and this total energy also equals half the potential at the \naverage distance \n  \n    \n      \n        a\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle a}\n  \n (the semi-major

In the elliptical orbit in between the speed varies from 10.15\u00a0km/s at the perigee to 1.61\u00a0km/s at the apogee.\n\nThe \u0394v for the two burns are thus 10.15\u00a0\u2212\u00a07.73 = 2.42 and 3.07\u00a0\u2212\u00a01.61 = 1.46\u00a0km/s, together 3.88\u00a0km/s.\n\nThis is greater than the \u0394v required for an escape orbit: 10.93\u00a0\u2212\u00a07.73 = 3.20\u00a0km/s. Applying a \u0394v at the Low Earth orbit (LEO) of only 0.78\u00a0km/s more (3.20\u22122.42) would give the rocket the escape speed, which is less than the \u0394v of 1.46\u00a0km/s required to circularize the geosynchronous orbit.  This illustrates the Oberth effect that at large speeds the same \u0394v provides more specific orbital energy, and energy increase is maximized if one spends the \u0394v as quickly as possible, rather than spending some, being decelerated by gravity, and then spending some more to overcome the deceleration (of course, the objective of a Hohmann transfer orbit is different).\n\n\nWorst case, maximum delta-v[edit]\n\nAs the example above demonstrates, the \u0394v required to perform a Hohmann transfer between two circular orbits is not the greatest when the destination radius is infinite.  (Escape speed is \u221a2 times orbital speed, so the \u0394v required to escape is \u221a2\u00a0\u2212\u00a01 (41.4%) of the orbital speed.) The \u0394v required is greatest (53.0% of smaller orbital speed) when the radius of the larger orbit is 15.5817... times that of the smaller orbit.[10] This number is the positive root of \u00a0x3\u00a0\u2212\u00a015\u00a0x2\u00a0\u2212\u00a09\u00a0x\u00a0\u2212\u00a01\u00a0=\u00a00, which is\u00a0 \n  \n    \n      \n        5\n        +\n        4\n        \n        \n          \n            7\n          \n        \n        cos\n        \u2061\n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              \n                1\n                3\n              \n            \n            arctan\n            \u2061\n            \n              \n                \n                  \n                    3\n                  \n                \n                37\n              \n            \n          \n          )\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle 5+4\\,{\\sqrt {7}}\\cos \\left({1 \\over 3}\\arctan {{\\sqrt {3}} \\over 37}\\right)}\n  \n.  For higher orbit ratios the \u0394v required for the second burn decreases faster than the first increases.\n\n\nApplication to interplanetary travel[edit]\n\nWhen used to move a spacecraft from orbiting one planet to orbiting another, the situation becomes somewhat more complex, but much less delta-v is required, due to the Oberth effect, than the sum of the delta-v required to escape the first planet plus the delta-v required for a Hohmann transfer to the second planet.\n\nFor example, consider a spacecraft travelling from the Earth to Mars. At the beginning of its journey, the spacecraft will already have a certain velocity and kinetic energy associated with its orbit around Earth. During the burn the rocket engine applies its delta-v, but the kinetic energy increases as a square law, until it is sufficient to escape the planet's gravitational potential, and then burns more so as to gain enough energy to get into the Hohmann transfer orbit (around the Sun). Because the rocket engine is able to make use of the initial kinetic energy of the propellant, far less delta-v is required over and above that needed to reach escape velocity, and the optimum situation is when the transfer burn is made at minimum altitude (low periapsis) above the planet. The delta-v needed is only 3.6\u00a0km/s, only about 0.4\u00a0km/s more than needed to escape Earth, even though this results in the spacecraft going 2.9\u00a0km/s faster than the Earth as it heads off for Mars (see table below).\n\nAt the other end, the spacecraft will need a certain velocity to orbit Mars, which will actually be less than the velocity needed to continue orbiting the Sun in the transfer orbit, let alone attempting to orbit the Sun in a Mars-like orbit. Therefore, the spacecraft will have to decelerate in order for the gravity of Mars to capture it. This capture burn should optimally be done at low altitude to also make best use of Oberth effect. Therefore, relatively small amounts of thrust at either end of the trip are needed to arrange the transfer compared to the free space situation.\n\nHowever, with any Hohmann transfer, the alignment of the two planets in their orbits is crucial \u2013 the destination planet and the spacecraft must arrive at the same point in their respective orbits around the Sun at the same time.  This requirement for alignment gives rise to the concept of launch windows.\n\nThe term lunar transfer orbit (LTO) is used for the Moon.\n\nIt is possible to apply the formula given above to calculate the \u0394v in km/s needed to enter a Hohmann transfer orbit to arrive at various destinations from Earth (assuming circular orbits for the planets). In this table, the column labeled \"\u0394v to enter Hohmann orbit from Earth's orbit\" gives the change from Earth's velocity to the velocity needed to get on a Hohmann ellipse whose other end will be at the desired distance from the Sun. The column labeled \"v exiting LEO\" gives the velocity needed (in a non-rotating frame of reference centered on the earth) when 300\u00a0km above the Earth's surface. This is obtained by adding to the specific kinetic energy the square of the speed (7.73\u00a0km/s) of this low Earth orbit (that is, the depth of Earth's gravity well at this LEO). The column \"\u0394v from LEO\" is simply the previous speed minus 7.73\u00a0km/s.\n\n\n\tDestination\n\tOrbital\nradius\n(AU)\n\t\u0394v (km/s)\n\n\tto enter Hohmann orbit\nfrom Earth's orbit\n\texiting\nLEO\n\tfrom\nLEO\n\n\tSun\n\t0\n\t29.8\n\t31.7\n\t24.0\n\n\tMercury\n\t0.39\n\t7.5\n\t13.3\n\t5.5\n\n\tVenus\n\t0.72\n\t2.5\n\t11.2\n\t3.5\n\n\tMars\n\t1.52\n\t2.9\n\t11.3\n\t3.6\n\n\tJupiter\n\t5.2\n\t8.8\n\t14.0\n\t6.3\n\n\tSaturn\n\t9.54\n\t10.3\n\t15.0\n\t7.3\n\n\tUranus\n\t19.19\n\t11.3\n\t15.7\n\t8.0\n\n\tNeptune\n\t30.07\n\t11.7\n\t16.0\n\t8.2\n\n\tPluto\n\t39.48\n\t11.8\n\t16.1\n\t8.4\n\n\tInfinity\n\t\u221e\n\t12.3\n\t16.5\n\t8.8\n\n\n\nNote that in most cases, \u0394v from LEO is less than the \u0394v to enter Hohmann orbit from Earth's orbit.\n\nTo get to the Sun, it is actually not necessary to use a \u0394v of 24\u00a0km/s. One can use 8.8\u00a0km/s to go very far away from the Sun, then use a negligible \u0394v to bring the angular momentum to zero, and then fall into the Sun. This can be considered a sequence of two Hohmann transfers, one up and one down. Also, the table does not give the values that would apply when using the Moon for a gravity assist. There are also possibilities of using one planet, like Venus which is the easiest to get to, to assist getting to other planets or the Sun.\n\n\nHohmann transfer versus low thrust orbits[edit]\n\nLow-thrust transfer[edit]\n\nLow-thrust engines can perform an approximation of a Hohmann transfer orbit, by creating a gradual enlargement of the initial circular orbit through carefully timed engine firings. This requires a change in velocity (delta-v) that is greater than the two-impulse transfer orbit[11] and takes longer to complete.\n\nEngines such as ion thrusters are more difficult to analyze with the delta-v model. These engines offer a very low thrust and at the same time, much higher delta-v budget, much higher specific impulse, lower mass of fuel and engine. A 2-burn Hohmann transfer maneuver would be impractical with such a low thrust; the maneuver mainly optimizes the use of fuel, but in this situation there is relatively plenty of it.\n\nIf only low-thrust maneuvers are planned on a mission, then continuously firing a low-thrust, but very high-efficiency engine might generate a higher delta-v and at the same time use less propellant than a conventional chemical rocket engine.\n\nGoing from one circular orbit to another by gradually changing the radius simply requires the same delta-v as the difference between the two speeds.[11] Such maneuver requires more delta-v than a 2-burn Hohmann transfer maneuver, but does so with continuous low thrust rather than the short applications of high thrust.\n\nThe amount of propellant mass used measures the efficiency of the maneuver plus the hardware employed for it. The total delta-v used measures the efficiency of the maneuver only. For electric propulsion systems, which tend to be low-thrust, the high efficiency of the propulsive system usually compensates for the higher delta-V compared to the more efficient Hohmann maneuver.\n\nTransfer orbit using electrical propulsion or low-thrust engines optimize the transfer time to reach the final orbit and not the delta-v as in the Hohmann transfer orbit. For geostationary orbit, the initial orbit is set to be supersynchronous and by thrusting continuously in the direction of the velocity at apogee, the transfer orbit transforms to a circular geosynchronous one. This method however takes much longer to achieve due to the low thrust injected into the orbit [12]\n\n\nInterplanetary Transport Network[edit]\n\nMain article: Interplanetary Transport Network\n\nIn 1997, a set of orbits known as the Interplanetary Transport Network (ITN) was published, providing even lower propulsive delta-v (though much slower and longer) paths between different orbits than Hohmann transfer orbits.[13]  The Interplanetary Transport Network is different in nature than Hohmann transfers because Hohmann transfers assume only one large body whereas the Interplanetary Transport Network does not.  The Interplanetary Transport Network is able to achieve the use of less propulsive delta-v by employing gravity assist from the planets.[citation needed]\n\n\nSee also[edit]\n\n\n\tSpaceflight portal\n\n\n\n\tBi-elliptic transfer\n\tDelta-v budget\n\tGeostationary transfer orbit\n\tHalo orbit\n\tLissajous orbit\n\tList of orbits\n\tOrbital mechanics\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n\t^ \"Hohmann transfer orbit diagram\". www.planetary.org.

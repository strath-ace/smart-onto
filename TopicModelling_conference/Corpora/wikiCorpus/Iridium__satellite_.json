Animation shows approximately 10\u00a0minutes.\n\n\n\nThe Iridium satellite constellation provides L-band voice and data coverage to satellite phones, pagers and integrated transceivers over the entire Earth surface. Iridium Communications owns and operates the constellation, additionally selling equipment and access to its services. It was originally conceived by Bary Bertiger, Raymond J. Leopold and Ken Peterson in late 1987 (in 1988 protected by patents Motorola filed in their names) and then developed by Motorola on a fixed-price contract from July 29, 1993, to November 1, 1998, when the system became operational and commercially available.\n\nThe constellation consists of 66 active satellites in orbit, required for global coverage, and additional spare satellites to serve in case of failure.[4] Satellites are in low Earth orbit at a height of approximately 485\u00a0mi (781\u00a0km) and inclination of 86.4\u00b0. Orbital velocity of the satellites is approximately 17,000\u00a0mph (27,000\u00a0km/h).  Satellites communicate with neighboring satellites via Ka band inter-satellite links. Each satellite can have four inter-satellite links: one each to neighbors fore and aft in the same orbital plane, and one each to satellites in neighboring planes to either side. The satellites orbit from pole to same pole with an orbital period of roughly 100\u00a0minutes.[5]\nThis design means that there is excellent satellite visibility and service coverage especially at the North and South poles. The over-the-pole orbital design produces \"seams\" where satellites in counter-rotating planes next to one another are traveling in opposite directions.  Cross-seam inter-satellite link hand-offs would have to happen very rapidly and cope with large Doppler shifts; therefore, Iridium supports inter-satellite links only between satellites orbiting in the same direction. The constellation of 66 active satellites has six\u00a0orbital planes spaced 30\u00b0 apart, with 11\u00a0satellites in each plane (not counting spares). The original concept was to have 77\u00a0satellites, which is where the name Iridium came from, being the element with the atomic number 77 and the satellites evoking the Bohr model image of electrons orbiting around the Earth as its nucleus. This reduced set of six\u00a0planes is sufficient to cover the entire Earth surface at every moment.\n\nBecause of the shape of the original Iridium satellites' reflective antennas, the first generation satellites focus sunlight on a small area of the Earth surface in an incidental manner. This results in an effect called Iridium flares, where the satellite momentarily appears as one of the brightest objects in the night sky and can be seen even during daylight.[6]  Newer Iridium satellites do not produce flares.\n\n\nContents\n\n\n\t1 Overview\n\t2 History\n\t2.1 Second generation\n\n\n\n\t3 Original Iridium constellation\n\t3.1 Launch campaign\n\t3.2 In-orbit spares\n\n\n\n\t4 Next-generation constellation\n\t4.1 Launch campaign\n\t4.2 Patents and manufacturing\n\n\n\n\t5 Defunct satellites\n\t5.1 Iridium 33 collision\n\n\n\n\t6 Devices\n\t7 See also\n\t8 References\n\t9 External links\n\n\n\n\n\nOverview[edit]\n\nThe Iridium system was designed to be accessed by small handheld phones, the size of a cell phone.  The omnidirectional antennas which are small enough to be mounted on such a phone, and the low battery power, are insufficient to allow the phone's radio waves to reach a satellite in geostationary orbit, 22,236 miles (35,785\u00a0km) above the Earth, the normal orbit of communications satellites, in which the satellite appears stationary in the sky.  In order for a handheld phone to communicate with them, the Iridium satellites are closer to the Earth, in low Earth orbit, about 485 miles (781\u00a0km) above the surface.  With an orbital period of about 100 minutes a satellite can only be in view of a phone for about 7 minutes, so the call is automatically \"handed off\" to another satellite when one passes beyond the local horizon.  This requires a large number of satellites, carefully spaced out in polar orbits (see animated image of coverage) to ensure that at least one satellite is continually in view from every point on the Earth's surface.  At least 66 satellites are required, in 6 polar orbits containing 11 satellites each, for seamless coverage.\n\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nThe Iridium satellite constellation was conceived in the early 1990s, as a way to reach high Earth latitudes with reliable satellite communication services.[7]\nEarly calculations showed that 77 satellites would be needed, hence the name Iridium, after the metal with atomic number 77. It turned out that just 66 were required to complete the  blanket coverage of the planet with communication services.[7][1]\n\nThe first-generation constellation was developed by Iridium SSC, and financed by Motorola.  The satellites were deployed in 1997\u20132002. All the satellites needed to be in orbit before commercial service could begin.[1]\n\nIridium SSC employed a globally diverse fleet of rockets to  get their 77 satellites into orbit, including launch vehicles (LVs) from the United States, Russia and China. 60 were launched to orbit on twelve Delta II LVs carrying five satellites each; 21 on three Proton-K/DM2 LVs with seven each, two on one Rokot/Briz-KM LVs carrying two; and 12 on six Long March 2C/SD LVs carrying two each.  The total setup cost for the first-generation fleet was approximately US$5 billion.[1]\n\nThe first test telephone call was made over the network in 1998, and full global coverage was complete by 2002.  However, although the system met its technical requirements, it was not a success in the market.  Insufficient market demand existed for the product at the price points on offer from Iridium as set by its parent company Motorola.  The company failed to earn revenue sufficient to service the debt associated with building out the constellation and Iridium went bankrupt, one of the largest bankruptcies in US history at the time.[1][7]\n\nThe constellation continued operation following the bankruptcy of the original Iridium corporation.  A new entity emerged to operate the satellites and developed a different product placement and pricing strategy, offering communication services to a niche market of customers who required reliable services of this type in areas of the planet not covered by traditional geosynchronous orbit communication satellite services.  Users include journalists, explorers, and military units.[7]\n\nNo new satellites were launched 2002\u20132017 to replenish the constellation, even though the original satellites based on the LM-700A model had been projected to have a design life of only 8 years.[1]\n\n\nSecond generation[edit]\n\nThe second-generation Iridium-NEXT satellites began to be deployed into the existing constellation in January 2017. Iridium Communications, the successor company to Iridium SSC, has ordered a total of 81 new satellites being built by Thales Alenia Space and Orbital ATK: 66 operational units, nine on-orbit spares, and six ground spares.[1]\n\nIn August 2008, Iridium selected two companies\u2014Lockheed Martin and Thales Alenia Space\u2014to participate in the final phase of the procurement of the next-generation satellite constellation.[8]\n\nAs of 2009[update], the original plan had been to begin launching new satellites in 2014.[9]\n\nThe design was complete by 2010, and Iridium stated that the existing constellation of satellites would remain operational until Iridium NEXT is fully operational, with many satellites expected to remain in service until the 2020s, while the NEXT satellites would have improved bandwidth. The new system was to be backward-compatible with the current system. In June 2010, the winner of the contract was announced as Thales Alenia Space, in a $2.1 billion deal underwritten by Compagnie Fran\u00e7aise d'Assurance pour le Commerce Ext\u00e9rieur.[8] Iridium additionally stated that it expected to spend about $800 million to launch the satellites and upgrade some ground facilities.[10]\n\nSpaceX was contracted to launch all the Iridium NEXT satellites. All the Iridium NEXT launches have taken place using a Falcon 9 rocket launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. Deployment of the constellation began in January 2017, with the launch of the first ten Iridium NEXT satellites.[11] Most recently, on January 11, 2019, SpaceX launched an additional ten satellites, bringing the number of upgraded satellites in orbit to 75.[12]\n\n\nOriginal Iridium constellation[edit]\n\n  \nAn Iridium flare due to Iridium 39\n\n\n\nPlay media\n  \nVideo of an Iridium flare in the constellation Cassiopeia\n\n\n\n  \nFlaring of Iridium satellites due to reflection of the Sun\n\n\n\nThe satellites each contained seven Motorola/Freescale PowerPC 603E processors running at roughly 200\u00a0MHz,[13] connected by a custom backplane network.  One processor was dedicated to each cross-link antenna (\"HVARC\"), and two processors (\"SVARC\"s) are dedicated to satellite control, one being a spare.  Late in the project an extra processor (\"SAC\") was added to perform resource management and phone call processing.\n\nThe cellular look down antenna had 48 spot beams arranged as 16 beams in three sectors.[14] The four inter-satellite cross links on each satellite operated at 10\u00a0Mbit/s.  Optical links could have supported a much greater bandwidth and a more aggressive growth path, but microwave cross links were chosen because their bandwidth was more than sufficient for the desired system.  Nevertheless, a parallel optical cross link option was carried through a critical design review, and ended when the microwave cross links were shown to support the size, weight and power requirements allocated within the individual satellite's budget.  Iridium Satellite LLC stated that their second generation satellites would also use microwave, not optical, inter-satellite communications links. Iridium's cross-links are unique in the satellite telephone industry as other providers do not relay data between satellites; Globalstar and Inmarsat both use a transponder without cross-links.\n\nThe original design as envisioned in the 1960s was that of a completely static \"dumb satellite\" with a set of control messages and time-triggers for an entire orbit that would be uploaded as the satellite passed over the poles. It was found that this design did not have enough bandwidth in the space-based backhaul to upload each satellite quickly and reliably over the poles. Moreover, fixed, static scheduling would have left more than 90% of the satellite links idle at all times.  Therefore, the design was scrapped in favour of a design that performed dynamic control of routing and channel selection late in the project, resulting in a one-year delay in system delivery.[citation needed]\n\nEach satellite can support up to 1100 concurrent phone calls at 2400 bit/s[15] and weighs about 1,500\u00a0lb (680\u00a0kg).[16] The Iridium System presently operates within a 1618.85 to 1626.5\u00a0MHz band, part of the wider L-band, adjacent to the 1610.6\u20131613.8\u00a0MHz Radio Astronomy Service (RAS) band.\n\nThe configuration of the Satellite concept was designated as Triangular Fixed, 80 Inch Main Mission Antenna, Light-weight (TF80L). The packaging design of the spacecraft was managed by Lockheed Bus Spacecraft team; it was the first commercial satellite bus designed at the Sunnyvale Space Systems Division in California. The TF80L configuration was considered a non-conventional, innovative approach to developing a satellite design that could be assembled and tested in five days. The TF80L design configuration was also instrumental in simultaneously solving fundamental design problems involving optimization of the communications payload thermal environment and RF main mission antenna performance, while achieving the highest payload fairing packaging for each of the three main launch vehicle providers.\n\nThe first spacecraft mock-up of this design was built in the garage workshop in Santa Clara, California for the Bus PDR/CDR as a proof-of-concept model. This first prototype paved the way for the design and construction of the first engineering models. This design was the basis of the largest constellation of satellites deployed in low earth orbit . After ten years of successful on-orbit performance, the Iridium team celebrated the equivalent of 1,000 cumulative years of on-orbit performance in 2008. One of the engineering Iridium satellite models was placed on permanent exhibit in the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum in Washington DC.\n\n\nLaunch campaign[edit]\n\n95 of the 99 built satellites were launched between 1997 and 2002. Three satellites were kept on the ground as spares.\n\nThe 95 satellites were launched over twenty-two missions (nine missions in 1997, ten in 1998, one in 1999 and two in 2002). One extra mission on Chang Zheng was a payload test and did not carry any actual satellites.\n\n\n\tLaunch date\n\tLaunch site\n\tLaunch vehicle\n\tSatellite number (at launch)[1]\n\n\t1997-05-05\n\tVandenberg\n\tDelta II 7920-10C\n\t4, 5, 6, 7, 8\n\n\t1997-06-18\n\tBaikonur\n\tProton-K/17S40\n\t9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16\n\n\t1997-07-09\n\tVandenberg\n\tDelta II 7920-10C\n\t15, 17, 18, 20, 21\n\n\t1997-08-21\n\tVandenberg\n\tDelta II 7920-10C\n\t22, 23, 24, 25, 26\n\n\t1997-09-01\n\tTaiyuan\n\tChang Zheng 2C-III/SD\n\tIridium payload test / no satellite\n\n\t1997-09-14\n\tBaikonur\n\tProton-K/17S40\n\t27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33\n\n\t1997-09-27\n\tVandenberg\n\tDelta II 7920-10C\n\t19, 34, 35, 36, 37\n\n\t1997-11-09\n\tVandenberg\n\tDelta II 7920-10C\n\t38, 39, 40, 41, 43\n\n\t1997-12-08\n\tTaiyuan\n\tChang Zheng 2C-III/SD\n\t42, 44\n\n\t1997-12-20\n\tVandenberg\n\tDelta II 7920-10C\n\t45, 46, 47, 48, 49\n\n\t1998-02-18\n\tVandenberg\n\tDelta II 7920-10C\n\t50, 52, 53, 54, 56\n\n\t1998-03-25\n\tTaiyuan\n\tChang Zheng 2C-III/SD\n\t51, 61\n\n\t1998-03-30\n\tVandenberg\n\tDelta II 7920-10C\n\t55, 57, 58, 59, 60\n\n\t1998-04-07\n\tBaikonur\n\tProton-K/17S40\n\t62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68\n\n\t1998-05-02\n\tTaiyuan\n\tChang Zheng 2C-III/SD\n\t69, 71\n\n\t1998-05-17\n\tVandenberg\n\tDelta II 7920-10C\n\t70, 72, 73, 74, 75\n\n\t1998-08-19\n\tTaiyuan\n\tChang Zheng 2C-III/SD\n\t3, 76\n\n\t1998-09-08\n\tVandenberg\n\tDelta II 7920-10C\n\t77, 79, 80, 81, 82\n\n\t1998-11-06\n\tVandenberg\n\tDelta II 7920-10C\n\t2, 83, 84, 85, 86\n\n\t1998-12-19\n\tTaiyuan\n\tChang Zheng 2C-III/SD\n\t11a, 20a\n\n\t1999-06-11\n\tTaiyuan\n\tChang Zheng 2C-III/SD\n\t14a, 21a\n\n\t2002-02-11\n\tVandenberg\n\tDelta II 7920-10C\n\t90, 91, 94, 95, 96\n\n\t2002-06-20\n\tPlesetsk\n\tRokot/Briz-KM\n\t97, 98\n\n\n\n^ \nIridium satellite number changed over time following failure and replacement.\n\n\nIn-orbit spares[edit]\n\n  \nIridium 6 and its replacement, #51, both flare in a 21-second exposure.\n\n\n\nSpare satellites are usually held in a 414\u00a0mi (666\u00a0km) storage orbit.[4] These can be boosted to the correct altitude and put into service in case of a satellite failure. After the Iridium company emerged from bankruptcy the new owners decided to launch seven new spares, which would have ensured two spare satellites were available in each plane. As of 2009[update], not every plane had a spare satellite; however, the satellites can be moved to a different plane if required. A move can take several weeks and consumes fuel which will shorten the satellite's expected service life.\n\nSignificant orbital inclination changes are normally very fuel-intensive, but orbital perturbation analysis aids the process. The Earth's equatorial bulge causes the orbital right ascension of the ascending node (RAAN) to precess at a rate that depends mainly on the period and inclination. The Iridium satellites have an inclination of 86.4\u00b0, which places every satellite in a prograde (inclination <\u00a090\u00b0) orbit. This causes their equator crossings to steadily precess westward.\n\nA spare Iridium satellite in the lower storage orbit has a shorter period so its RAAN moves westward more quickly than the satellites in the standard orbit. Iridium simply waits until the desired RAAN (i.e., the desired orbital plane) is reached and then raises the spare satellite to the standard altitude, fixing its orbital plane with respect to the constellation. Although this saves substantial amounts of fuel, it can be a time-consuming process.\n\nAs of mid-2016, Iridium has experienced in-orbit failures which cannot be corrected with in-orbit spare satellites, thus only 64 of the 66 satellites required for seamless global coverage were in operation. Therefore, service interruptions can be observed, especially around the equatorial region where the satellite footprints are most spread out and there is least overlap.[17]\n\n\nNext-generation constellation[edit]\n\n  \nIridium Next Constellation\n\n\n\nIn 2017, Iridium began launching[18][19][20][21]  Iridium NEXT, a second-generation worldwide network of telecommunications satellites, consisting of 66 active satellites, with another nine in-orbit spares and six on-ground spares.  These satellites incorporate features such as data transmission that were not emphasized in the original design.[22]  The constellation provides L-band data speeds of up to 128\u00a0kbit/s to mobile terminals, up to 1.5\u00a0Mbit/s to Iridium Pilot marine terminals, and high-speed Ka-band service of up to 8\u00a0Mbit/s to fixed/transportable terminals.[23] The next-generation terminals and service became commercially available in 2018.[24]\n\nThe NEXT satellites incorporate a secondary payload for Aireon,[25] a space-qualified ADS-B data receiver for use by air traffic control and, via FlightAware, by airlines.[26] A tertiary payload on 58 satellites is a marine AIS ship-tracker receiver for Canadian company exactEarth Ltd.[27]\n\nIridium NEXT also provides data link to other satellites in space, enabling command and control of other space assets regardless of the position of ground stations and gateways.[22]\n\n\nLaunch campaign[edit]\n\nIn June 2010, Iridium signed the largest commercial rocket-launch deal ever at that time, a US$492\u00a0million contract with SpaceX to launch 70 Iridium NEXT satellites on seven Falcon 9 rockets from 2015 to 2017 via SpaceX leased launch facility at Vandenberg Air Force Base.[28] The final two satellites were originally slated to be orbited by a single launch[29] of an ISC Kosmotras Dnepr.[30] Technical issues and consequential demands from Iridium's insurance delayed the launch of the first pair of Iridium NEXT satellites until April 2016.[31]\n\nIridium NEXT launch plans originally[32] included launch of satellites on both Ukrainian Dnepr launch vehicles and SpaceX Falcon 9 launch vehicles, with the initial satellites launching on Dnepr in April 2016; however, in February 2016, Iridium announced a change.  Due to an extended slowdown in obtaining the requisite launch licenses from Russian authorities, Iridium revamped the entire launch sequence for the 75-satellite constellation. It launched and successfully deployed 10 satellites with SpaceX on January 14, 2017, delayed due to weather from January 9, 2017,[33] and the first of those new satellites took over the duties of an old satellite on March 11, 2017.[34]\n\nAt the time of the launch of the first batch, the second flight of ten satellites was planned to launch only three\u00a0months later in April 2017.[35]  However, in a February 15 statement, Iridium said that SpaceX pushed back the launch of its second batch of Iridium NEXT satellites from mid-April to mid-June 2017. This second launch, which occurred on June 25, 2017, delivered another ten Iridium NEXT satellites to low Earth-orbit (LEO) on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. A third launch, which occurred on October 9, 2017, delivered another ten satellites to LEO, as planned. The Iridium NEXT IV mission launched with ten satellites on 23 December 2017. The penultimate mission, Iridium NEXT V, launched with ten satellites on 30 March 2018. The final ten Next satellites launched on 11 Jan 2019. Six additional satellites are in storage on the ground as spares.\n\n\n\tLaunch date\n\tLaunch site\n\tLaunch vehicle\n\tSatellite numbers (at launch)[2]\n\n\t2017-01-14\n\tVandenberg\n\tFalcon 9 FT\n\t102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 108, 109, 111, 112, 114\n\n\t2017-06-25\n\tVandenberg\n\tFalcon 9 FT\n\t113, 115, 117, 118, 120, 121, 123, 124, 126, 128\n\n\t2017-10-09\n\tVandenberg\n\tFalcon 9 B4\n\t100, 107, 119, 122, 125, 129, 132, 133, 136, 139[citation needed]\n\n\t2017-12-23\n\tVandenberg\n\tFalcon 9 FT\n\t116, 130, 131, 134, 135, 137, 138, 141, 151, 153\n\n\t2018-03-30\n\tVandenberg\n\tFalcon 9 B4\n\t140, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 148, 149, 150, 157\n\n\t2018-05-22\n\tVandenberg\n\tFalcon 9 B4\n\t110, 147, 152, 161, 162[citation needed]\n\n\t2018-07-25\n\tVandenberg\n\tFalcon 9 B5\n\t154, 155, 156, 158, 159, 160, 163, 164, 165, 166[citation needed]\n\n\t2019-01-11\n\tVandenberg\n\tFalcon 9 B5\n\t167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 175, 176, 180[citation needed]\n\n\n\n^ \nIridium satellite number could change over time following failure and replacement.\n\nIridium 127 was renumbered Iridium 100.[36][when?] Iridium 101, 174, 177, 178, 179 and 181 are the ground spares.[37]\n\n\nPatents and manufacturing[edit]\n\nThe main patents on the Iridium system, U.S. Patents 5,410,728: \"Satellite cellular telephone and data communication system\", and 5,604,920, are in the field of satellite communications, and the manufacturer generated several hundred patents protecting the technology in the system. Satellite manufacturing initiatives were also instrumental in the technical success of the system.  Motorola made a key hire of the engineer who set up the automated factory for Apple's Macintosh.  He created the technology necessary to mass-produce satellites on a gimbal, taking weeks instead of months or years and at a record low construction cost of only US$5 million per satellite.  At its peak during the launch campaign in 1997 and 1998, Motorola produced a new satellite every 4.3 days, with the lead-time of a single satellite being 21 days.[38][non-primary source needed]\n\n\nDefunct satellites[edit]\n\nOver the years a number of Iridium satellites have ceased to work and are no longer in active service, some are partially functional and have remained in orbit whereas others have tumbled out of control or have reentered the atmosphere.[39]\n\nIridium 21, 27, 20, 11, 24, 71, 44, 14, 79, 69 and 85 all suffered from issues before entering operational service soon after their launch in 1997. By 2018, of these eleven, Iridium 21, 27, 79 and 85 have decayed out of orbit; Iridium 11, 14, 20 and 21 were renamed to Iridium 911, 914, 920 and 921 respectively since replacements of the same name were launched.[40]\n\nFrom 2017, several first-generation Iridium satellites have been deliberately de-orbited after being replaced by operational Iridium NEXT satellites.[41]\n\n\n\tList of defunct

the 2009 satellite collision\n\tRussian and US satellites collide\n\tBurning debris from satellites spotted over several US cities:\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\nMain article: 2009 satellite collision\n\nAt 16:56 UTC on February 10, 2009, Iridium 33 collided with the defunct Russian satellite Kosmos 2251.[43] This accidental collision was the first hypervelocity collision between two artificial satellites in low Earth orbit.[44][45] Iridium 33 was in active service when the accident took place. It was one of the oldest satellites in the constellation, having been launched in 1997. The satellites collided at a relative speed of roughly 35,000\u00a0km/h (22,000 miles per hour)[46] This collision created large amounts of space debris that can be hazardous to other satellites.[clarification needed]\n\nIridium moved one of its in-orbit spares, Iridium 91 (formerly known as Iridium 90), to replace the destroyed satellite,[47] completing the move on March 4, 2009.\n\n\nDevices[edit]\n\nMain article: Iridium Communications \u00a7\u00a0Subscriber equipment\n\n  \nUsing an Iridium phone in Antarctica\n\n\n\nSeveral types of terminals are marketed by Iridium. These include devices manufactured by Motorola, Kyocera, and Iridium themselves. Some are intended for use in extreme conditions such as polar exploration.\n\n\nSee also[edit]\n\n\tMobile-satellite service\n\tSatellite phone\n\tCelestri\n\tGlobalstar\n\tGlobalsat Group\n\tIntersputnik\n\tIntelsat\n\tInmarsat\n\tOneWeb\n\tO3b Networks\n\tOrbcomm\n\tRadiotelephone\n\tSES Broadband for Maritime\n\tThuraya\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n\t^ a b c d e f g \nGraham, William (2018-03-29). \"Iridium NEXT-5 satellites set to ride on SpaceX Falcon 9\".

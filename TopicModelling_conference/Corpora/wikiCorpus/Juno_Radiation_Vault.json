Jupiter in 2000 on its way to Saturn\n\n\n\nJuno Radiation Vault is a compartment inside the Juno spacecraft that houses much of the probe's electronics and computers, and is intended to offer increased protection of radiation to the contents as the spacecraft endures the radiation environment at planet Jupiter.[1] The Juno Radiation Vault is roughly a cube, with walls made of 1\u00a0cm thick (1/3 of an inch) titanium metal, and each side having an area of about a square meter (10 square feet).[2] The vault weights about 200\u00a0kg (500\u00a0lbs).[3] Inside the vault are the main command and data handling and power control boxes, along with 20 other electronic boxes.[2] The vault should reduce the radiation exposure by about 800 times,  as the spacecraft is exposed to an anticipated 20 million rads of radiation[1] It does not stop all radiation, but significantly reduces it in order to limit damage to the spacecraft's electronics.[2]\n\nThe vault has been compared being like \"armor\" or like a \"tank\", and the electronics within, like the spacecraft's \"brain\".[4] The power systems have been described as a \"heart\".[5]\n\n\nWithout its protective shield, or radiation vault, Juno\u2019s brain would get fried on the very first pass near Jupiter\n\u2014\u2009Juno's PI[6]\n\n\n\nThe vault is one of many features of the mission to help counter the high radiation levels near Jupiter, including an orbit that reduces time spent in the highest radiation regions, radiation-hardened electronics, and additional shielding on components.[3] The wires that lead out from the vault also have increased protection, they have a sheath of braided copper and stainless steel.[3] Some other components used tantalum metal for shielding in Juno, and while lead  is known for its shielding effect it was found to be too soft in this application.[7] One reason that titanium was chosen over lead in this application was because titanium was better at handling launch stresses.[7]\n\nThe Ganymede orbiter proposal also included a design for a Juno-like radiation vault.[8] However, because the radiation is less at Jupiter's moon Ganymede and the orbiter's path, the vault would not have to be as thick, all else being similar.[8] One reason the radiation is strong at Jupiter, but confined to certain belts, is because it is generated by ions and electrons trapped in areas as a result of Jupiter's magnetic field.[9] Jupiter's magnetosphere is about 20,000 times as strong as Earth's and is one of the items of study by Juno.[10] (see also Juno's Magnetometer (MAG) instrument)\n\nAnother spacecraft with radiation shields was Skylab, which needed a radiation shield over a borosilicate glass window to stop it darkening, and several film vaults.[11] There were five vaults for photographic film aboard the Skylab space station, and the largest weighed 1088\u00a0kg (2398\u00a0lb).[12][11] Juno is the first time a spacecraft has a titanium vault for its electronics however.[13] Radiation hardening in general is an important part of spacecraft design when it is required, and the main processor of Juno, the RAD750, has been used on other spacecraft where there are elevated radiation levels, and it is a radiation-hardened microprocessor.[13] For example, the RAD750 was also used on the Curiosity rover, launched November 26, 2011[14]\n\nJuno is a space probe sent to Jupiter in 2011 and it entered orbit the night of July 4, 2016.[15] Juno is part of the New Frontiers program of NASA and was also built with some contributions by the Italian Space Agency (ASI).[15]\n\nIt was suggested by the publication Popular Science that the Europa Lander may use a radiation vault like the Juno Jupiter orbiter.[16]\n\n\nContents\n\n\n\t1 Inside the

intended to reduce the amount of radiation they receive.[17]\n\nExamples of components inside the vault:\n\n\n\tCommand and data handling box[2]\n\tRAD750 microprocessor[13]\n\tPower and data

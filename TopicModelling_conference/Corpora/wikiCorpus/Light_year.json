The unit most commonly used in professional astrometry is the parsec (symbol: pc, about 3.26 light-years; the distance at which one astronomical unit subtends an angle of one second of arc).[2]\n\n\nContents\n\n\n\t1 Definitions\n\t2 History\n\t3 Usage of term\n\t4 Related units\n\t5 See also\n\t6 Notes\n\t7 References\n\t8 External links\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinitions[edit]\n\nAs defined by the IAU, the light-year is the product of the Julian year[note 2] (365.25 days as opposed to the 365.2425-day Gregorian year) and the speed of light (299792458\u00a0m/s).[note 3] Both of these values are included in the IAU (1976) System of Astronomical Constants, used since 1984.[4] From this, the following conversions can be derived. The IAU recognized abbreviation for light-year is ly,[2] although other standards like ISO 80000 use \"l.y.\"[5][6] and localized abbreviations are frequent, such as \"al\" in French (from ann\u00e9e-lumi\u00e8re) and Spanish (from a\u00f1o luz), \"Lj\" in German (from Lichtjahr), etc.\n\n\n\t\t1 light-year \u00a0\n\t= 9460730472580800 metres (exactly)\n\n\t\u2248 9.461 petametres\n\n\t\u2248 9.461 trillion kilometres\n\n\t\u2248 5.878625 trillion miles\n\n\t\u2248 63241.077 astronomical units\n\n\t\u2248 0.306601 parsecs\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore 1984, the tropical year (not the Julian year) and a measured (not defined) speed of light were included in the IAU (1964) System of Astronomical Constants, used from 1968 to 1983.[7] The product of Simon Newcomb's J1900.0 mean tropical year of 31556925.9747 ephemeris seconds and a speed of light of 299792.5\u00a0km/s produced a light-year of 9.460530\u00d71015\u00a0m (rounded to the seven significant digits in the speed of light) found in several modern sources[8][9][10] was probably derived from an old source such as C. W. Allen's 1973 Astrophysical Quantities reference work,[11] which was updated in 2000, including the IAU (1976) value cited above (truncated to 10 significant digits).[12]\n\nOther high-precision values are not derived from a coherent IAU system. A value of 9.460536207\u00d71015\u00a0m found in some modern sources[13][14] is the product of a mean Gregorian year (365.2425 days or 31556952\u00a0s) and the defined speed of light (299792458\u00a0m/s). Another value, 9.460528405\u00d71015\u00a0m,[15][16] is the product of the J1900.0 mean tropical year and the defined speed of light.\n\nAbbreviations used for light years and multiples of light years are\n\n\n\t\"ly\" for one light year[2]\n\t\"kly\" for a kilolight-year (1,000 light years)[17]\n\t\"Mly\" for a megalight-year (1,000,000 light years)[18]\n\t\"Gly\" for a gigalight-year (1,000,000,000 light years)[19]\n\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nThe light-year unit appeared a few years after the first successful measurement of the distance to a star other than the Sun, by Friedrich Bessel in 1838. The star was 61 Cygni, and he used a 6.2-inch (160\u00a0mm) heliometer designed by Joseph von Fraunhofer. The largest unit for expressing distances across space at that time was the astronomical unit, equal to the radius of the Earth's orbit (1.50\u00d7108\u00a0km or 9.30\u00d7107\u00a0mi). In those terms, trigonometric calculations based on 61 Cygni's parallax of 0.314 arcseconds, showed the distance to the star to be 660000 astronomical units (9.9\u00d71013\u00a0km or 6.1\u00d71013\u00a0mi). Bessel added that light employs 10.3 years to traverse this distance.[20] He recognized that his readers would enjoy the mental picture of the approximate transit time for light, but he refrained from using the light-year as a unit. He may have resented expressing distances in light-years because it would deteriorate the accuracy of his parallax data due to multiplying with the uncertain parameter of the speed of light.\n\nThe speed of light was not yet precisely known in 1838; its value changed in 1849 (Fizeau) and 1862 (Foucault). It was not yet considered to be a fundamental constant of nature, and the propagation of light through the aether or space was still enigmatic.\n\nThe light-year unit appeared  in 1851 in a German popular astronomical article by Otto Ule.[21] The paradox of a distance unit name ending on \"year\" was explained by Ule by comparing it to a hiking road hour (Wegstunde).\n\nA contemporary German popular astronomical book also noticed that light-year is an odd name.[22] In 1868 an English journal labelled the light-year as a unit used by the Germans.[23] Eddington called the light-year an inconvenient and irrelevant unit, which had sometimes crept from popular use into technical investigations.[24]\n\nAlthough modern astronomers often prefer to use the parsec, light years are also popularly used to gauge the expanses of interstellar and intergalactic space.\n\n\nUsage of term[edit]\n\nDistances expressed in light-years include those between stars in the same general area, such as those belonging to the same spiral arm or globular cluster. Galaxies themselves span from a few thousand to a few hundred thousand light-years in diameter, and are separated from neighbouring galaxies and galaxy clusters by millions of light-years. Distances to objects such as quasars and the Sloan Great Wall run up into the billions of light-years.\n\n\nList of orders of magnitude for length\n\tScale (ly)\n\tValue\n\tItem\n\n\t10\u22129\n\t4.04\u00d710\u22128\u00a0ly\n\tReflected sunlight from the Moon's surface takes 1.2\u20131.3 seconds to travel the distance to the Earth's surface (travelling roughly 350000 to 400000 kilometres).\n\n\t10\u22126\n\t1.58\u00d710\u22125\u00a0ly\n\tOne astronomical unit (the distance from the Sun to the Earth).

This is larger than the age of the universe dictated by the cosmic background radiation; see here for why this is possible.\n\n\n\nRelated units[edit]\n\nDistances between objects within a star system tend to be small fractions of a light year, and are usually expressed in astronomical units. However, smaller units of length can similarly be formed usefully by multiplying units of time by the speed of light. For example, the light-second, useful in astronomy, telecommunications and relativistic physics, is exactly 299792458 metres or \u200b1\u204431557600 of a light-year. Units such as the light-minute, light-hour and light-day are sometimes used in popular science publications. The light-month, roughly one-twelfth of a light-year, is also used occasionally for approximate measures.[34][35] The Hayden Planetarium specifies the light month more precisely as 30 days of light travel time.[36]\n\nLight travels approximately one foot in a nanosecond; the term \"light-foot\" is sometimes used as an informal measure of time.[37]\n\n\nSee also[edit]\n\n\t1 petametre (examples of distances on the order of one light-year)\n\tDistance measures (cosmology)\n\tEinstein protocol\n\tHubble length\n\tOrders of magnitude (length)\n\tSpeed of light\n\n\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n\t^ One trillion here is taken to be 1012 (one million million, or billion in long scale).\n\n\t^ One Julian year is of exactly 365.25 days (or 31557600\u00a0s based on a day of exactly 86400 SI seconds)[3]\n\n\t^ The speed of light is precisely 299792458\u00a0m/s by definition of the metre.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n\t^ The Universe within 12.5 Light Years: The Nearest Stars\n\n\t^ a b c d e International Astronomical Union, Measuring the Universe: The IAU and Astronomical Units, retrieved 10 November 2013\n\n\t^ IAU Recommendations concerning Units, archived from the original on 2007-02-16\n\n\n\t^ \"Selected Astronomical Constants\" in Astronomical Almanac, p. 6.\n\n\t^ ISO 80000-3:2006 Quantities and Units \u2013 Space and Time\n\n\t^ IEEE/ASTM SI 10-2010, American National Standard for Metric Practice\n\n\t^ P.

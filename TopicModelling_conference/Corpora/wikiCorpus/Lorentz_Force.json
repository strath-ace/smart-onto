This article will not follow this nomenclature: In what follows, the term \"Lorentz force\" will refer to the expression for the total force.\n\nThe magnetic force component of the Lorentz force manifests itself as the force that acts on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field. In that context, it is also called the Laplace force.\n\nThe Lorentz force is a force exerted by the electromagnetic field on the charged particle, that is, it is the rate at which linear momentum is transferred from the electromagnetic field to the particle. Associated with it is the power which is the rate at which energy is transferred from the electromagnetic field to the particle. That power is\n\n\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          v\n        \n        \u22c5\n        \n          F\n        \n        =\n        q\n        \n        \n          v\n        \n        \u22c5\n        \n          E\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {v} \\cdot \\mathbf {F} =q\\,\\mathbf {v} \\cdot \\mathbf {E} }\n  \n.\n\n\nNotice that the magnetic field does not contribute to the power because the magnetic force is always perpendicular to the velocity of the particle.\n\n\nContinuous charge distribution[edit]\n\n  \nLorentz force (per unit 3-volume) f on a continuous charge distribution (charge density \u03c1) in motion. The 3-current density J corresponds to the motion of the charge element dq in volume element dV and varies throughout the continuum.\n\n\n\nFor a continuous charge distribution in motion, the Lorentz force equation becomes:\n\n\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          d\n        \n        \n          F\n        \n        =\n        \n          d\n        \n        q\n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              E\n            \n            +\n            \n              v\n            \n            \u00d7\n            \n              B\n            \n          \n          )\n        \n        \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {d} \\mathbf {F} =\\mathrm {d} q\\left(\\mathbf {E} +\\mathbf {v} \\times \\mathbf {B} \\right)\\,\\!}\n  \n\n\n\nwhere dF is the force on a small piece of the charge distribution with charge dq.

It was proposed that the force on magnetic poles, by Johann Tobias Mayer and others in 1760,[10] and electrically charged objects, by Henry Cavendish in 1762,[11] obeyed an inverse-square law. However, in both cases the experimental proof was neither complete nor conclusive. It was not until 1784 when Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, using a torsion balance, was able to definitively show through experiment that this was true.[12] Soon after the discovery in 1820 by H. C. \u00d8rsted that a magnetic needle is acted on by a voltaic current, Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re that same year was able to devise through experimentation the formula for the angular dependence of the force between two current elements.[13][14] In all these descriptions, the force was always given in terms of the properties of the objects involved and the distances between them rather than in terms of electric and magnetic fields.[15]\n\nThe modern concept of electric and magnetic fields first arose in the theories of Michael Faraday, particularly his idea of lines of force, later to be given full mathematical description by Lord Kelvin and James Clerk Maxwell.[16] From a modern perspective it is possible to identify in Maxwell's 1865 formulation of his field equations a form of the Lorentz force equation in relation to electric currents,[3] however, in the time of Maxwell it was not evident how his equations related to the forces on moving charged objects. J. J. Thomson was the first to attempt to derive from Maxwell's field equations the electromagnetic forces on a moving charged object in terms of the object's properties and external fields. Interested in determining the electromagnetic behavior of the charged particles in cathode rays, Thomson published a paper in 1881 wherein he gave the force on the particles due to an external magnetic field as[5]\n\n\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          F\n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            q\n            2\n          \n        \n        \n          v\n        \n        \u00d7\n        \n          B\n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {F} ={\\frac {q}{2}}\\mathbf {v} \\times \\mathbf {B} .}\n  \n\n\n\nThomson derived the correct basic form of the formula, but, because of some miscalculations and an incomplete description of the displacement current, included an incorrect scale-factor of a half in front of the formula.  Oliver Heaviside invented the modern vector notation and applied it to Maxwell's field equations; he also (in 1885 and 1889) had fixed the mistakes of Thomson's derivation and arrived at the correct form of the magnetic force on a moving charged object.[5][17][18] Finally, in 1895,[4][19] Hendrik Lorentz derived the modern form of the formula for the electromagnetic force which includes the contributions to the total force from both the electric and the magnetic fields. Lorentz began by abandoning the Maxwellian descriptions of the ether and conduction. Instead, Lorentz made a distinction between matter and the luminiferous aether and sought to apply the Maxwell equations at a microscopic scale. Using Heaviside's version of the Maxwell equations for a stationary ether and applying Lagrangian mechanics (see below), Lorentz arrived at the correct and complete form of the force law that now bears his name.[20][21]\n\n\nTrajectories of particles due to the Lorentz force[edit]\n\nMain article: Guiding center\n\n  \nCharged particle drifts in a homogeneous magnetic field. (A) No disturbing force (B) With an electric field, E (C) With an independent force, F (e.g. gravity) (D) In an inhomogeneous magnetic field, grad H\n\n\n\nIn many cases of practical interest, the motion in a magnetic field of an electrically charged particle (such as an electron or ion in a plasma) can be treated as the superposition of a relatively fast circular motion around a point called the guiding center and a relatively slow drift of this point. The drift speeds may differ for various species depending on their charge states, masses, or temperatures, possibly resulting in electric currents or chemical separation.\n\n\nSignificance of the Lorentz force[edit]\n\nWhile the modern Maxwell's equations describe how electrically charged particles and currents or moving charged particles give rise to electric and magnetic fields, the Lorentz force law completes that picture by describing the force acting on a moving point charge q in the presence of electromagnetic fields.[6][22] The Lorentz force law describes the effect of E and B upon a point charge, but such electromagnetic forces are not the entire picture. Charged particles are possibly coupled to other forces, notably gravity and nuclear forces. Thus, Maxwell's equations do not stand separate from other physical laws, but are coupled to them via the charge and current densities. The response of a point charge to the Lorentz law is one aspect; the generation of E and B by currents and charges is another.\n\nIn real materials the Lorentz force is inadequate to describe the collective behavior of charged particles, both in principle and as a matter of computation. The charged particles in a material medium not only respond to the E and B fields but also generate these fields. Complex transport equations must be solved to determine the time and spatial response of charges, for example, the Boltzmann equation or the Fokker\u2013Planck equation or the Navier\u2013Stokes equations. For example, see magnetohydrodynamics, fluid dynamics, electrohydrodynamics, superconductivity, stellar evolution. An entire physical apparatus for dealing with these matters has developed. See for example, Green\u2013Kubo relations and Green's function (many-body theory).\n\n\nLorentz force law as the definition of E and B[edit]\n\nIn many textbook treatments of classical electromagnetism, the Lorentz force Law is used as the definition of the electric and magnetic fields E and B.[23][24][25] To be specific, the Lorentz force is understood to be the following empirical statement:\n\n\n\tThe electromagnetic force F on a test charge at a given point and time is a certain function of its charge q and velocity v, which can be parameterized by exactly two vectors E and B, in the functional form:\n\n\n\t\t\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          F\n        \n        =\n        q\n        (\n        \n          E\n        \n        +\n        \n          v\n        \n        \u00d7\n        \n          B\n        \n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {F} =q(\\mathbf {E} +\\mathbf {v} \\times \\mathbf {B} )}\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThis is valid, even for particles approaching the speed of light (that is, magnitude of v = |v| \u2248 c).[26] So the two vector fields E and B are thereby defined throughout space and time, and these are called the \"electric field\" and \"magnetic field\". The fields are defined everywhere in space and time with respect to what force a test charge would receive regardless of whether a charge is present to experience the force.\n\nAs a definition of E and B, the Lorentz force is only a definition in principle because a real particle (as opposed to the hypothetical \"test charge\" of infinitesimally-small mass and charge) would generate its own finite E and B fields, which would alter the electromagnetic force that it experiences. In addition, if the charge experiences acceleration, as if forced into a curved trajectory by some external agency, it emits radiation that causes braking of its motion. See for example Bremsstrahlung and synchrotron light. These effects occur through both a direct effect (called the radiation reaction force) and indirectly (by affecting the motion of nearby charges and currents). Moreover, net force must include gravity, electroweak, and any other forces aside from electromagnetic force.\n\n\nForce on a current-carrying wire[edit]\n\n  \nRight-hand rule for a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field B\n\n\n\nWhen a wire carrying an electric current is placed in a magnetic field, each of the moving charges, which comprise the current, experiences the Lorentz force, and together they can create a macroscopic force on the wire (sometimes called the Laplace force). By combining the Lorentz force law above with the definition of electric current, the following equation results, in the case of a straight, stationary wire:[27]\n\n\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          F\n        \n        =\n        I\n        \n          \u2113\n        \n        \u00d7\n        \n          B\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {F} =I{\\boldsymbol {\\ell }}\\times \\mathbf {B} }\n  \n\n\n\nwhere \u2113 is a vector whose magnitude is the length of wire, and whose direction is along the wire, aligned with the direction of conventional current charge flow I.\n\nIf the wire is not straight but curved, the force on it can be computed by applying this formula to each infinitesimal segment of wire d\u2113, then adding up all these forces by integration. Formally, the net force on a stationary, rigid wire carrying a steady current I is\n\n\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          F\n        \n        =\n        I\n        \u222b\n        \n          d\n        \n        \n          \u2113\n        \n        \u00d7\n        \n          B\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {F} =I\\int \\mathrm {d} {\\boldsymbol {\\ell }}\\times \\mathbf {B} }\n  \n\n\n\nThis is the net force. In addition, there will usually be torque, plus other effects if the wire is not perfectly rigid.\n\nOne application of this is Amp\u00e8re's force law, which describes how two current-carrying wires can attract or repel each other, since each experiences a Lorentz force from the other's magnetic field. For more information, see the article: Amp\u00e8re's force law.\n\n\nEMF[edit]\n\nThe magnetic force (qv \u00d7 B) component of the Lorentz force is responsible for motional electromotive force (or motional EMF), the phenomenon underlying many electrical generators. When a conductor is moved through a magnetic field, the magnetic field exerts opposite forces on electrons and nuclei in the wire, and this creates the EMF. The term \"motional EMF\" is applied to this phenomenon, since the EMF is due to the motion of the wire.\n\nIn other electrical generators, the magnets move, while the conductors do not. In this case, the EMF is due to the electric force (qE) term in the Lorentz Force equation. The electric field in question is created by the changing magnetic field, resulting in an induced EMF, as described by the Maxwell\u2013Faraday equation (one of the four modern Maxwell's equations).[28]\n\nBoth of these EMFs, despite their apparently distinct origins, are described by the same equation, namely, the EMF is the rate of change of magnetic flux through the wire. (This is Faraday's law of induction, see below.) Einstein's special theory of relativity was partially motivated by the desire to better understand this link between the two effects.[28] In fact, the electric and magnetic fields are different facets of the same electromagnetic field, and in moving from one inertial frame to another, the solenoidal vector field portion of the E-field can change in whole or in part to a B-field or vice versa.[29]\n\n\nLorentz force and Faraday's law of induction[edit]\n\n  \nLorentz force -image on a wall in Leiden\n\n\n\nMain article: Faraday's law of induction\n\nGiven a loop of wire in a magnetic field, Faraday's law of induction states the induced electromotive force (EMF) in the wire is:\n\n\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            E\n          \n        \n        =\n        \u2212\n        \n          \n            \n              \n                d\n              \n              \n                \u03a6\n                \n                  B\n                \n              \n            \n            \n              \n                d\n              \n              t\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\mathcal {E}}=-{\\frac {\\mathrm {d} \\Phi _{B}}{\\mathrm {d} t}}}\n  \n\n\n\nwhere\n\n\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u03a6\n          \n            B\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \u222c\n          \n            \u03a3\n            (\n            t\n            )\n          \n        \n        \n          d\n        \n        \n          A\n        \n        \u22c5\n        \n          B\n        \n        (\n        \n          r\n        \n        ,\n        t\n        )\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\Phi _{B}=\\iint _{\\Sigma (t)}\\mathrm {d} \\mathbf {A} \\cdot \\mathbf {B} (\\mathbf {r} ,t)}\n  \n\n\n\nis the magnetic flux through the loop, B is the magnetic field, \u03a3(t) is a surface bounded by the closed contour \u2202\u03a3(t), at all at time t, dA is an infinitesimal vector area element of \u03a3(t) (magnitude is the area of an infinitesimal patch of surface, direction is orthogonal to that surface patch).\n\nThe sign of the EMF is determined by Lenz's law. Note that this is valid for not only a stationary wire\u00a0\u2013 but also for a moving wire.\n\nFrom Faraday's law of induction (that is valid for a moving wire, for instance in a motor) and the Maxwell Equations, the Lorentz Force can be deduced. The reverse is also true, the Lorentz force and the Maxwell Equations can be used to derive the Faraday Law.\n\nLet \u03a3(t) be the moving wire, moving together without rotation and with constant velocity v and \u03a3(t) be the internal surface of the wire.

However, there are cases where Faraday's law is either inadequate or difficult to use, and application of the underlying Lorentz force law is necessary. See inapplicability of Faraday's law.\n\nIf the magnetic field is fixed in time and the conducting loop moves through the field, the magnetic flux \u03a6B linking the loop can change in several ways. For example, if the B-field varies with position, and the loop moves to a location with different B-field, \u03a6B will change. Alternatively, if the loop changes orientation with respect to the B-field, the B \u22c5 dA differential element will change because of the different angle between B and dA, also changing \u03a6B. As a third example, if a portion of the circuit is swept through a uniform, time-independent B-field, and another portion of the circuit is held stationary, the flux linking the entire closed circuit can change due to the shift in relative position of the circuit's component parts with time (surface \u2202\u03a3(t) time-dependent). In all three cases, Faraday's law of induction then predicts the EMF generated by the change in \u03a6B.\n\nNote that the Maxwell Faraday's equation implies that the Electric Field E is non conservative when the Magnetic Field B varies in time, and is not expressible as the gradient of a scalar field, and not subject to the gradient theorem since its rotational is not zero.[30][32]\n\n\nLorentz force in terms of potentials[edit]\n\nSee also: Mathematical descriptions of the electromagnetic field, Maxwell's equations, and Helmholtz decomposition\n\nThe E and B fields can be replaced by the magnetic vector potential A and (scalar) electrostatic potential \u03d5  by\n\n\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          E\n        \n        =\n        \u2212\n        \u2207\n        \u03d5\n        \u2212\n        \n          \n            \n              \u2202\n              \n                A\n              \n            \n            \n              \u2202\n              t\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {E} =-\\nabla \\phi -{\\frac {\\partial \\mathbf {A} }{\\partial t}}}\n  \n\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          B\n        \n        =\n        \u2207\n        \u00d7\n        \n          A\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {B} =\\nabla \\times \\mathbf {A} }\n  \n\n\n\nwhere \u2207 is the gradient, \u2207\u22c5 is the divergence, \u2207\u00d7 is the curl.\n\nThe force becomes\n\n\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          F\n        \n        =\n        q\n        \n          [\n          \n            \u2212\n            \u2207\n            \u03d5\n            \u2212\n            \n              \n                \n                  \u2202\n                  \n                    A\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \u2202\n                  t\n                \n              \n            \n            +\n            \n              v\n            \n            \u00d7\n            (\n            \u2207\n            \u00d7\n            \n              A\n            \n            )\n          \n          ]\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {F} =q\\left[-\\nabla \\phi -{\\frac {\\partial \\mathbf {A} }{\\partial t}}+\\mathbf {v} \\times (\\nabla \\times \\mathbf {A} )\\right]}\n  \n\n\n\nand using an identity for the triple product simplifies to\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          F\n        \n        =\n        q\n        \n          [\n          \n            \u2212\n            \u2207\n            \u03d5\n            \u2212\n            \n              \n                \n                  \u2202\n                  \n                    A\n                  \n                \n                \n                  \u2202\n                  t\n                \n              \n            \n            +\n            \u2207\n            (\n            \n              v\n            \n            \u22c5\n            \n              A\n            \n            )\n            \u2212\n            (\n            \n              v\n            \n            \u22c5\n            \u2207\n            )\n            \n              A\n            \n          \n          ]\n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathbf {F} =q\\left[-\\nabla \\phi -{\\frac {\\partial \\mathbf {A} }{\\partial t}}+\\nabla (\\mathbf {v} \\cdot \\mathbf {A} )-(\\mathbf {v} \\cdot \\nabla )\\mathbf {A} \\right]}\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n(v has no dependence on position, so there's no need to use Feynman's subscript notation).

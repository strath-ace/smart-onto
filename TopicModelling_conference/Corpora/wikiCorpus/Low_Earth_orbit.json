The altitude of an object in an elliptic orbit can vary significantly along the orbit. Even for circular orbits, the altitude above ground can vary by as much as 30\u00a0km (19\u00a0mi) (especially for polar orbits) due to the oblateness of Earth's spheroid figure and local topography.  While definitions based on altitude are inherently ambiguous, most of them fall within the range specified by an orbit period of 128 minutes because, according to Kepler's third law, this corresponds to a semi-major axis of 8,413\u00a0km (5,228\u00a0mi). For circular orbits, this in turn corresponds to an altitude of 2,042\u00a0km (1,269\u00a0mi) above the mean radius of Earth, which is consistent with some of the upper altitude limits in some LEO definitions.\n\nThe LEO region is defined by some sources as the region in space that LEO orbits occupy.[1][7][8][9] Some highly elliptical orbits may pass through the LEO region near their lowest altitude (or perigee) but are not in an LEO Orbit because their highest altitude (or apogee) exceeds 2,000\u00a0km (1,200\u00a0mi). Sub-orbital objects can also reach the LEO region but are not in an LEO orbit because they re-enter the atmosphere. The distinction between LEO orbits and the LEO region is especially important for analysis of possible collisions between objects which may not themselves be in LEO but could collide with satellites or debris in LEO orbits.   \n\nThe International Space Station conducts operations in LEO. All crewed space stations to date, as well as the majority of satellites, have been in LEO.  The altitude record for human spaceflights in LEO was Gemini 11 with an apogee of 1,374.1\u00a0km (853.8\u00a0mi). Apollo 8 was the first mission to carry humans beyond LEO on December 21\u201327, 1968. The Apollo program continued during the four-year period spanning 1968 through 1972 with 24 astronauts who flew lunar flights but since then there have been no human spaceflights beyond LEO.\n\n\nContents\n\n\n\t1 Orbital characteristics\n\t2 Use of LEO\n\t2.1 Disadvantages\n\t2.2 Examples\n\n\n\n\t3 Space debris\n\t4 See also\n\t5 Notes\n\t6 References\n\n\n\n\n\nOrbital characteristics[edit]\n\nThe mean orbital velocity needed to maintain a stable low Earth orbit is about 7.8\u00a0km/s (28,000\u00a0km/h; 17,000\u00a0mph), but reduces with increased orbital altitude. Calculated for circular orbit of 200\u00a0km (120\u00a0mi) it is 7.79\u00a0km/s (28,000\u00a0km/h; 17,400\u00a0mph), and for 1,500\u00a0km (930\u00a0mi) it is 7.12\u00a0km/s (25,600\u00a0km/h; 15,900\u00a0mph).[10] The delta-v needed to achieve low Earth orbit starts around 9.4\u00a0km/s. Atmospheric and gravity drag associated with launch typically adds 1.3\u20131.8\u00a0km/s (4,700\u20136,500\u00a0km/h; 2,900\u20134,000\u00a0mph) to the launch vehicle delta-v required to reach normal LEO orbital velocity of around 7.8\u00a0km/s (28,080\u00a0km/h; 17,448\u00a0mph).[11]\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pull of gravity in LEO is only slightly less than on the Earth's surface. This is because the distance to LEO from the Earth's surface is far less than the Earth's radius. However, an object in orbit is, by definition, in free fall, since there is no force holding it up. As a result objects in orbit, including people, experience a sense of weightlessness, even though they are not actually without weight.\n\nObjects in LEO encounter atmospheric drag from gases in the thermosphere (approximately 80\u2013500\u00a0km above the surface) or exosphere (approximately 500\u00a0km or 311\u00a0mi and up), depending on orbit height. Due to atmospheric drag, satellites do not usually orbit below 300\u00a0km (190\u00a0mi). Objects in LEO orbit Earth between the denser part of the atmosphere and below the inner Van Allen radiation belt.\n\nEquatorial low Earth orbits (ELEO) are a subset of LEO. These orbits, with low inclination to the Equator, allow rapid revisit times and have the lowest delta-v requirement (i.e., fuel spent) of any orbit. Orbits with a high inclination angle to the equator are usually called polar orbits.\n\nHigher orbits include medium Earth orbit (MEO), sometimes called intermediate circular orbit (ICO), and further above, geostationary orbit (GEO). Orbits higher than low orbit can lead to early failure of electronic components due to intense radiation and charge accumulation.\n\n\n\"VLEO\" redirects here. For other uses, see VLEO (disambiguation).\n\nIn 2017, a very low-Earth orbit (or very-low LEO orbit) began to be seen in regulatory filings.  This orbit, referred to as \"VLEO\", requires the use of novel technologies for orbit raising because they operate in orbits that would ordinarily decay too soon to be economically useful.[12]\n\n\nUse of LEO[edit]\n\nPlay media\n  \nRoughly half an orbit of the ISS.\n\n\n\nA low Earth orbit requires the lowest amount of energy for satellite placement. It provides high bandwidth and low communication latency. Satellites and space stations in LEO are more accessible for crew and servicing. \n\nSince it requires less energy to place a satellite into a LEO, and a satellite there needs less powerful amplifiers for successful transmission, LEO is used for many communication applications, such as the Iridium phone system. Some communication satellites use much higher geostationary orbits, and move at the same angular velocity as the Earth as to appear stationary above one location on the planet.\n\n\nDisadvantages[edit]\n\nSatellites in LEO have a small momentary field of view, only able to observe and communicate with a fraction of the Earth at a time, meaning a network (or \"constellation\") of satellites is required to in order to provide continuous coverage. Satellites in lower regions of LEO also suffer from fast orbital decay, requiring either periodic reboosting to maintain a stable orbit, or launching replacement satellites when old ones re-enter.\n\n\nExamples[edit]\n\n\tEarth observation satellites and spy satellites use LEO as they are able to see the surface of the Earth clearly by being close to it. They are also able to traverse the surface of the Earth. A majority of artificial satellites are placed in LEO,[13] making one complete revolution around the Earth in about 90 minutes.\n\tThe International Space Station is in a LEO about 330\u00a0km (210\u00a0mi) to 420\u00a0km (260\u00a0mi) above Earth's surface,[14] and needs reboosting a few times a year due to orbital decay.\n\tIridium satellites orbit at about  780\u00a0km (480\u00a0mi).\n\tLower orbits also aid remote sensing satellites because of the added detail that can be gained. Remote sensing satellites can also take advantage of sun-synchronous LEO orbits at an altitude of about 800\u00a0km (500\u00a0mi) and near polar inclination. Envisat (2002\u20132012) is one example of an Earth observation satellite that makes use of this particular type of LEO (at 770\u00a0km (480\u00a0mi)).\n\tGOCE orbited at about 255\u00a0km (158\u00a0mi) to measure Earth's gravity field.\n\tGRACE were, and GRACE-FO are, orbiting at about 500\u00a0km (310\u00a0mi)\n\tThe Hubble Space Telescope orbits at about 540\u00a0km (340\u00a0mi) above Earth.\n\tThe Chinese Tiangong-2 station orbits at about 370\u00a0km (230\u00a0mi).\n\n\nSpace debris[edit]\n\nThe LEO environment is becoming congested with space debris because of the frequency of object launches.  This has caused growing concern in recent years, since collisions at orbital velocities can easily be dangerous, and even deadly. Collisions can produce even more space debris in the process, creating a domino effect, something known as Kessler Syndrome. The Joint Space Operations Center, part of United States Strategic Command (formerly the United States Space Command), currently tracks more than 8,500 objects larger than 10\u00a0cm in LEO.[15] However, a limited Arecibo Observatory study suggested there could be approximately one million objects larger than 2 millimeters,[16] which are too small to be visible from Earth-based observatories.[17]\n\n\nSee also[edit]\n\n\n\tSpaceflight portal\n\tAstronomy portal\n\tSolar System portal\n\tSpace portal\n\n\n\n\n\tComparison of orbital launch systems\n\tGeostationary orbit (GEO)\n\tHeavy lift launch vehicle\n\tHigh Earth orbit (HEO)\n\tHighly elliptical orbit (HEO)\n\tList of orbits\n\tMedium Earth orbit (MEO)\n\tMedium-lift launch vehicle\n\tSpecific orbital energy examples\n\tSuborbital spaceflight\n\tVan Allen radiation belt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes[edit]\n\n\n\t^ Orbital periods and speeds are calculated using the relations 4\u03c02R3\u00a0=\u00a0T2GM and V2R\u00a0=\u00a0GM, where R = radius of orbit in metres, T = orbital period in seconds, V = orbital speed in m/s, G = gravitational constant \u2248 6.673\u00d710\u221211\u00a0Nm2/kg2, M = mass of Earth \u2248 5.98\u00d71024\u00a0kg.\n\n\t^ Approximately 8.6 times (in radius and length) when the moon is nearest (363\u2009104 km \u00f7 42\u2009164 km) to 9.6 times when the moon is farthest (405\u2009696 km \u00f7 42\u2009164 km).\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\n\t^ a b \"IADC Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines\" (PDF).

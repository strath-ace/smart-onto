Having no direction, it is a scalar quantity.  In the International System of Units, the unit of power is the joule per second (J/s), known as the watt in honour of James Watt, the eighteenth-century developer of the condenser steam engine.  Another common and traditional measure is horsepower (comparing to the power of a horse).  Being the rate of work, the equation for power can be written as:\n\n\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          power\n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            work\n            time\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\text{power}}={\\frac {\\text{work}}{\\text{time}}}}\n  \n\n\n\nAs a physical concept, power requires both a change in the physical system and a specified time in which the change occurs. This is distinct from the concept of work, which is only measured in terms of a net change in the state of the physical system. The same amount of work is done when carrying a load up a flight of stairs whether the person carrying it walks or runs, but more power is needed for running because the work is done in a shorter amount of time. \n\nThe output power of an electric motor is the product of the torque that the motor generates and the angular velocity of its output shaft. The power involved in moving a ground vehicle is the product of the traction force on the wheels and the velocity of the vehicle. The power of a jet-propelled vehicle is the product of the engine thrust and the velocity of the vehicle. The rate at which a light bulb converts electrical energy into light and heat is measured in watts\u2014the higher the wattage, the more power, or equivalently the more electrical energy is used per unit time.[1][2]\n\n\nContents\n\n\n\t1 Units\n\t2 Equations for power\n\t3 Average power\n\t4 Mechanical power\n\t4.1 Mechanical advantage\n\n\n\n\t5 Electrical power\n\t6 Peak power and duty cycle\n\t7 Radiant power\n\t8 See also\n\t9 References\n\t10 External links\n\n\n\n\n\nUnits[edit]\n\nThe dimension of power is energy divided by time. The SI unit of power is the watt (W), which is equal to one joule per second. Other units of power include ergs per second (erg/s), horsepower (hp), metric horsepower (Pferdest\u00e4rke (PS) or cheval vapeur (CV)), and foot-pounds per minute. One horsepower is equivalent to 33,000 foot-pounds per minute, or the power required to lift 550 pounds by one foot in one second, and is equivalent to about 746 watts. Other units include dBm, a logarithmic measure relative to a reference of 1 milliwatt; food calories per hour (often referred to as kilocalories per hour); BTU per hour (BTU/h); and tons of refrigeration (12,000 BTU/h).\n\n\nEquations for power[edit]\n\nPower, as a function of time, is the rate (i.e. derivative) at which work is done, so can be expressed by this equation:\n\n\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        P\n        =\n        \n          \n            \n              d\n              W\n            \n            \n              d\n              t\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle P={\\frac {dW}{dt}}}\n  \n\n\n\nwhere P is power, W is work, and t is time.

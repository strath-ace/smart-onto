It can also be described as the proportion of the mechanical energy actually used to propel the aircraft. It is always less than one, because conservation of momentum requires that the exhaust have some of the kinetic energy, and the propulsive mechanism (whether propeller, jet exhaust, or ducted fan) is never perfectly efficient. Overall propulsive efficiency is greatly dependent on air density and airspeed.\n\nMathematically, it is represented as \n  \n    \n      \n        \u03b7\n        =\n        \n          \u03b7\n          \n            c\n          \n        \n        \n          \u03b7\n          \n            p\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\eta =\\eta _{c}\\eta _{p}}\n  \n,[1] where \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u03b7\n          \n            c\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\eta _{c}}\n  \n is the cycle efficiency and \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \u03b7\n          \n            p\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\eta _{p}}\n  \n is the mechanical efficiency.\n\n\nContents\n\n\n\t1 Cycle efficiency\n\t2 Mechanical efficiency\n\t2.1 Jet engines\n\t2.2 Rocket engines\n\t2.3 Propeller engines\n\n\n\n\t3 See also\n\t4 References\n\t5 Notes\n\n\n\n\n\nCycle efficiency[edit]\n\nMain article: Heat engine \u00a7\u00a0Efficiency\n\nMost aerospace vehicles are propelled by heat engines of some kind, usually an internal combustion engine.

However, in practice, this results in a very low specific impulse, causing much greater losses due to the need for exponentially larger masses of propellant. Unlike ducted engines, rockets give thrust even when the two speeds are equal.\n\nIn 1903, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky discussed the average propulsive efficiency of a rocket, which he called the utilization (utilizatsiya), the \"portion of the total work of the explosive material transferred to the rocket\" as opposed to the exhaust gas.[5]\n\n\nPropeller engines[edit]\n\n  \nPropulsive efficiency comparison for various gas turbine engine configurations\n\n\n\nThe calculation is somewhat different for reciprocating and turboprop engines which rely on a propeller for propulsion since their output is typically expressed in terms of power rather than thrust.

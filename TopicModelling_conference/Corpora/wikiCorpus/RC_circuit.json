A first order RC circuit is composed of one resistor and one capacitor and is the simplest type of RC circuit.\n\nRC circuits can be used to filter a signal by blocking certain frequencies and passing others. The two most common RC filters are  the high-pass filters and low-pass filters; band-pass filters and band-stop filters usually require RLC filters, though crude ones can be made with RC filters.\n\n\nContents\n\n\n\t1 Introduction\n\t2 Natural response\n\t3 Complex impedance\n\t3.1 Sinusoidal steady state\n\n\n\n\t4 Series circuit\n\t4.1 Transfer functions\n\t4.1.1 Poles and zeros\n\n\n\n\t4.2 Gain and phase\n\t4.3 Current\n\t4.4 Impulse response\n\t4.5 Frequency-domain considerations\n\t4.6 Time-domain considerations\n\t4.6.1 Integrator\n\t4.6.2 Differentiator\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t5 Parallel circuit\n\t6 See also\n\t7 References\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction[edit]\n\nThere are three basic, linear passive lumped analog circuit components: the resistor (R), the capacitor (C), and the inductor (L). These may be combined in the RC circuit, the RL circuit, the LC circuit, and the RLC circuit, with the acronyms indicating which components are used. These circuits, among them, exhibit a large number of important types of behaviour that are fundamental to much of analog electronics. In particular, they are able to act as passive filters. This article considers the RC circuit, in both series and parallel forms, as shown in the diagrams below.\n\n\nNatural response[edit]\n\n  \nRC circuit\n\n\n\nThe simplest RC circuit is a capacitor and a resistor in parallel. When a circuit consists of only a charged capacitor and a resistor, the capacitor will discharge its stored energy through the resistor. The voltage across the capacitor, which is time dependent, can be found by using Kirchhoff's current law, where the current discharging the capacitor must equal the current through the resistor.  This results in the linear differential equation\n\n\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        C\n        \n          \n            \n              d\n              V\n            \n            \n              d\n              t\n            \n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          \n            V\n            R\n          \n        \n        =\n        0\n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle C{\\frac {dV}{dt}}+{\\frac {V}{R}}=0\\,,}\n  \n\n\n\nwhere C is the capacitance of the capacitor.\n\nSolving this equation for V yields the formula for exponential decay: \n\n\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        V\n        (\n        t\n        )\n        =\n        \n          V\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        \n          e\n          \n            \u2212\n            \n              \n                t\n                \n                  R\n                  C\n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle V(t)=V_{0}e^{-{\\frac {t}{RC}}}\\,,}\n  \n\n\n\nwhere V0 is the capacitor voltage at time t = 0.\n\nThe time required for the voltage to fall to V0/e is called the RC time constant and is given by[1]:1.13\n\n\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        \u03c4\n        =\n        R\n        C\n        \n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\tau =RC\\,.}\n  \n\n\n\nWhere \u03c4 is measured in seconds, R in Ohms and C in Farads.\n\n\nComplex impedance[edit]\n\nThe complex impedance, ZC (in ohms) of a capacitor with capacitance C (in farads) is \n\n\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          Z\n          \n            C\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \n            1\n            \n              s\n              C\n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle Z_{C}={\\frac {1}{sC}}}\n  \n\n\n\nThe complex frequency s is, in general, a complex number,\n\n\n\t\n  \n    \n      \n        s\n        =\n        \u03c3\n        +\n        j\n        \u03c9\n        \n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle s=\\sigma +j\\omega \\,,}\n  \n\n\n\nwhere\n\n\n\tj represents the imaginary unit: j2 = \u22121,\n\t\u03c3 is the exponential decay constant (in nepers per second), and\n\t\u03c9 is the sinusoidal angular frequency (in radians per second).\n\n\nSinusoidal steady state[edit]\n\nSinusoidal steady state is a special case in which the input voltage consists of a pure sinusoid (with no exponential decay).

Thus, the circuit behaves as a low-pass filter. If, though, the output is taken across the resistor, high frequencies are passed and low frequencies are attenuated (since the capacitor blocks the signal as its frequency approaches 0). In this configuration, the circuit behaves as a high-pass filter.\n\nThe range of frequencies that the filter passes is called its bandwidth. The point at which the filter attenuates the signal to half its unfiltered power is termed its cutoff frequency.

These equations can be rewritten in terms of charge and current using the relationships C = Q/V and V = IR (see Ohm's law).\n\nThus, the voltage across the capacitor tends towards V as time passes, while the voltage across the resistor tends towards 0, as shown in the figures. This is in keeping with the intuitive point that the capacitor will be charging from the supply voltage as time passes, and will eventually be fully charged.\n\nThese equations show that a series RC circuit has a time constant, usually denoted \u03c4 = RC being the time it takes the voltage across the component to either rise (across the capacitor) or fall (across the resistor) to within 1/e of its final value. That is, \u03c4 is the time it takes VC to reach V(1 \u2212 1/e) and VR to reach V(1/e).\n\nThe rate of change is a fractional 1 \u2212 1/e per \u03c4. Thus, in going from t = N\u03c4 to t = (N + 1)\u03c4, the voltage will have moved about 63.2% of the way from its level at t = N\u03c4 toward its final value. So the capacitor will be charged to about 63.2% after \u03c4, and essentially fully charged (99.3%) after about 5\u03c4. When the voltage source is replaced with a short-circuit, with the capacitor fully charged, the voltage across the capacitor drops exponentially with t from V towards 0. The capacitor will be discharged to about 36.8% after \u03c4, and essentially fully discharged (0.7%) after about 5\u03c4.

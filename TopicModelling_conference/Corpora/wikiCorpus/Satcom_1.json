The illuminated (right hand) side of the satellite is one set of solar panels which were extended when the satellite propelled itself to its geostationary orbit\n\n\n\nThe Satcom series was a family of communications satellites originally developed and operated by RCA American Communications (RCA Americom). Satcom was one of the early geostationary satellites; the first were the Syncom series, in 1964. The first Satcom satellite, Satcom 1, was launched on December 13, 1975. The last satellite, Satcom K2, was placed into orbit on November 27, 1985 and was de-orbited in February 2002. Satcom was first superseded and then replaced by the GE series of satellites.\n\nSatcom (which stands for \"satellite communication\") was an artificial geo-stationary satellite that facilitated wide-area telecommunications by receiving radio signals from Earth, amplifying them, and relaying them back down to terrestrial receivers.\n\nThe Satcom system passed to General Electric with its purchase of RCA in 1986. RCA Americom became GE American Communications (GE Americom) and the satellite construction division became GE Astro Space. GE Astro Space was sold to Martin Marietta (now Lockheed Martin Space Systems) in 1993. In 2001 GE sold GE Americom to SES Global, creating SES Americom.\n\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nMost early commercial communications satellites were built for and operated by telecommunications companies. RCA, with its own RCA Astro Electronics satellite construction business, identified a role for itself as a satellite owner/operator.\n\nSatcom 1 was used as the launching ground for many cable TV services including HBO, Showtime, Superstation TBS, Nickelodeon, the FBC Network of Tom Ficara, the CBN cable network (now Freeform), ESPN, and The Weather Channel.  The satellite spurred the cable television industry to unprecedented heights with the assistance of HBO (who moved their programming from the competing Westar 1, where they had been since their nationwide debut in 1975, to Satcom 1 in February 1976). Cable television networks relay signals to ground-based cable television headends using satellites, which allowed cable TV to enter into the suburban and metropolitan markets, thus allowing HBO to accumulate 1.6 million subscribers by the end of 1977.\n\nA notable legal battle involved Ted Turner suing RCA to get a Satcom 1 transponder in 1980 for the launch of CNN on June 1, 1980. CNN had been scheduled for a Satcom 3 transponder but that satellite failed to reach geosynchronous orbit upon its launch on December 7, 1979.\n\nShortly after its launch, Satcom 1 was the first satellite used by broadcast TV networks in the United States. The networks ABC, NBC, and CBS distributed their programming content to some local affiliate stations, which had before relied on AT&T's terrestrial microwave and coaxial networks to distribute & relay programming (although NBC used it on an experimental basis for this purpose in the late 1970s).  The networks fed to both Satcom 1 and AT&T's network at the same time (for the benefit of those stations who hadn't yet been equipped with earth station equipment for reception of the satellite) up until the breakup of AT&T in 1984, when the networks switched exclusively to satellite distribution on Satcom 1 (and later satellites), due to the much lower transmission costs, as well as due to AT&T's divestiture itself.\n\nThe reason that Satcom 1 was so widely used by both cable and broadcast TV networks is that it had twice the communications capacity of the competing Westar 1 (24 transponders as opposed to Westar 1's 12), which resulted in lower transponder usage costs in general.\n\n\nSatellite fleet[edit]\n\nAll the remaining Satcom satellites were retired in the early 2000s and replaced by the GE/AMC series, originally by GE Americom, then sold to SES.\n\n\n\tModel\n\tManufacturer\n\tLaunch date\n\tLaunch vehicle\n\tCOSPAR ID\n\tComments\n\n\tSatcom 1\n\tRCA Astro Electronics\n\tDecember 12, 1975\n\tDelta 3000\n\t1975-117A\n\t\n\n\tSatcom 2\n\tRCA Astro Electronics\n\tMarch 26, 1976\n\tDelta 3000\n\t1976-029A\n\t\n\n\tSatcom 3\n\tRCA Astro Electronics\n\tDecember 7, 1979\n\tDelta 3000\n\t1979-101A\n\tFailure during GTO (currently in non-geosynchronous orbit)\n\n\tSatcom 1R\n\tRCA Astro Electronics\n\tApril 11, 1983\n\tDelta 3000\n\t1983-030A\n\tReplaced Satcom 1\n\n\tSatcom 2R\n\tRCA Astro Electronics\n\tSeptember 8, 1983\n\tDelta 3000\n\t1983-094A\n\tReplaced Satcom 2\n\n\tSatcom 3R\n\tRCA Astro Electronics\n\tNovember 20, 1981\n\tDelta 3000\n\t1981-114A\n\tReplaced Satcom 3\n\n\tSatcom 4\n\tRCA Astro Electronics\n\tJanuary 16, 1982\n\tDelta 3000\n\t1982-004A\n\t\n\n\tSatcom 5\n\tRCA Astro Electronics\n\tOctober 28, 1982\n\tDelta 3000\n\t1982-105A\n\tAlso called Aurora 1, still on 105.2'W (2006)[1]\n\n\tSatcom 4R\n\tHughes\n\tNovember 8, 1984\n\tSTS-51-A (Discovery)\n\t1984-113B\n\tLaunched as Anik D2, purchased in orbit\n\n\tSatcom C1\n\tGE Astro Space\n\tNovember 20, 1990\n\tAriane 42P\n\t1990-100A\n\tReplaced Satcom 1R\n\n\tSatcom C3\n\tGE Astro Space\n\tSeptember 11, 1992\n\tAriane 44LP\n\t1992-060B\n\t\n\n\tSatcom C4\n\tGE Astro Space\n\tAugust 31, 1992\n\tDelta II (7925)\n\t1992-057A\n\t\n\n\tSatcom C5\n\tGE Astro Space\n\tMay 29, 1991\n\tDelta II (7925)\n\t1991-037A\n\tOriginally called Aurora 2, replaced Aurora 1 / Satcom 5\n\n\tSatcom K1\n\tRCA Astro Electronics\n\tJanuary 12, 1986\n\tSTS-61-C (Columbia)\n\t1986-003B\n\t\n\n\tSatcom K2\n\tRCA Astro Electronics\n\tNovember 27, 1985\n\tSTS-61-B (Atlantis)\n\t1985-109D\n\t\n\n\tSatcom K3\n\tGE Astro Space\n\tMarch 2, 1991\n\tAriane 44LP\n\t1991-015A\n\tSold during construction to SES;

For other uses, see Orbital vehicle (disambiguation).\n\n  \nMore than 100 Soviet and Russian crewed Soyuz spacecraft (TMA version shown) have flown since 1967 and now support the International Space Station.\n\n\n\n  \nThe US Space Shuttle flew 135 times from 1981 to 2011, supporting Spacelab, Mir, the Hubble Space Telescope, and the ISS. (Columbia's first launch, which had a white external tank, shown)\n\n\n\nA spacecraft is a vehicle or machine designed to fly in outer space. A type of artificial satellite, spacecraft are used for a variety of purposes, including communications, Earth observation, meteorology, navigation, space colonization, planetary exploration, and transportation of humans and cargo. All spacecraft except single-stage-to-orbit vehicles cannot get into space on their own, and require a launch vehicle (carrier rocket).\n\nOn a sub-orbital spaceflight, a space vehicle enters space and then returns to the surface, without having gained sufficient energy or velocity to make a full orbit of the Earth. For orbital spaceflights, spacecraft enter closed orbits around the Earth or around other celestial bodies. Spacecraft used for human spaceflight carry people on board as crew or passengers from start or on orbit (space stations) only, whereas those used for robotic space missions operate either autonomously or telerobotically. Robotic spacecraft used to support scientific research are space probes. Robotic spacecraft that remain in orbit around a planetary body are artificial satellites. To date, only a handful of interstellar probes, such as Pioneer 10 and 11, Voyager 1 and 2, and New Horizons, are on trajectories that leave the Solar System.\n\nOrbital spacecraft may be recoverable or not. Most are not.  Recoverable spacecraft may be subdivided by method of reentry to Earth into non-winged space capsules and winged spaceplanes.\n\nHumanity has achieved space flight but only a few nations have the technology for orbital launches: Russia (RSA or \"Roscosmos\"), the United States (NASA), the member states of the European Space Agency (ESA), Japan (JAXA), China (CNSA), India (ISRO), Taiwan[1][2][3][4][5][6] (National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology, Taiwan National Space Organization (NSPO),[7][8][9] Israel (ISA), Iran (ISA), and North Korea (NADA).\n\n\nContents\n\n\n\t1 History\n\t2 Spacecraft types\n\t2.1 Crewed spacecraft\n\t2.1.1 Spaceplanes\n\n\n\n\t2.2 Unmanned spacecraft\n\t2.2.1 Designed as manned but flown as unmanned only spacecraft\n\t2.2.2 Semi-manned \u2013 manned as space stations or part of space stations\n\t2.2.3 Earth-orbit satellites\n\t2.2.4 Lunar probes\n\t2.2.5 Planetary probes\n\t2.2.6 Other \u2013 deep space\n\t2.2.7 Fastest spacecraft\n\t2.2.8 Furthest spacecraft from the Sun\n\n\n\n\t2.3 Unfunded and canceled programs\n\t2.3.1 Manned spacecraft\n\t2.3.2 Multi-stage spaceplanes\n\t2.3.3 SSTO spacecraft\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t3 Spacecraft under development\n\t3.1 Crewed\n\t3.2 Uncrewed\n\n\n\n\t4 Subsystems\n\t5 See also\n\t6 References\n\t7 External links\n\n\n\n\n\nHistory[edit]\n\nSee also: History of spaceflight\n\n  \nThe first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1. It was launched by the Soviet Union\n\n\n\nA German V-2 became the first spacecraft when it reached an altitude of 189\u00a0km in June 1944 in Peenem\u00fcnde, Germany.[10] Sputnik 1 was the first artificial satellite. It was launched into an elliptical low Earth orbit (LEO) by the Soviet Union on 4 October 1957. The launch ushered in new political, military, technological, and scientific developments;  while the Sputnik launch was a single event, it marked the start of the Space Age.[11][12] Apart from its value as a technological first, Sputnik 1 also helped to identify the upper atmospheric layer's density, through measuring the satellite's orbital changes. It also provided data on radio-signal distribution in the ionosphere. Pressurized nitrogen in the satellite's false body provided the first opportunity for meteoroid detection. Sputnik 1 was launched during the International Geophysical Year from Site No.1/5, at the 5th Tyuratam range, in Kazakh SSR (now at the Baikonur Cosmodrome). The satellite travelled at 29,000 kilometers (18,000\u00a0mi) per hour, taking 96.2 minutes to complete an orbit, and emitted radio signals at 20.005 and 40.002\u00a0MHz\n\nWhile Sputnik 1 was the first spacecraft to orbit the Earth, other man-made objects had previously reached an altitude of 100\u00a0km, which is the height required by the international organization F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale to count as a spaceflight. This altitude is called the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line. In particular, in the 1940s there were several test launches of the V-2 rocket, some of which reached altitudes well over 100\u00a0km.\n\n\nSpacecraft types[edit]\n\nCrewed spacecraft[edit]\n\nSee also: List of crewed spacecraft and Human spaceflight\n \n  \nApollo 17 Command Module in Lunar orbit\n\n\n\nAs of 2016, only three nations have flown crewed spacecraft: USSR/Russia, USA, and China. \nThe first crewed spacecraft was Vostok 1, which carried Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin into space in 1961, and completed a full Earth orbit. There were five other crewed missions which used a Vostok spacecraft.[13] The second crewed spacecraft was named Freedom 7, and it performed a sub-orbital spaceflight in 1961 carrying American astronaut Alan Shepard to an altitude of just over 187 kilometers (116\u00a0mi). There were five other crewed missions using Mercury spacecraft.\n\nOther Soviet crewed spacecraft include the Voskhod, Soyuz, flown uncrewed as Zond/L1, L3, TKS, and the Salyut and Mir crewed space stations. Other American crewed spacecraft include the Gemini spacecraft, Apollo spacecraft including the Apollo Lunar Module, the Skylab space station, and the Space Shuttle with undetached European Spacelab and private US Spacehab space stations-modules. China developed, but did not fly Shuguang, and is currently using Shenzhou (its first crewed mission was in 2003).\n\nExcept for the Space Shuttle, all of the recoverable crewed orbital spacecraft were space capsules.\n\n\n\tCrewed space capsules\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\nAmerican Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo spacecraft\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\nSoviet Voskhod (variant of Vostok)\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\n1967 Soviet/Russian Soyuz spacecraft\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\nChinese Shenzhou\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\nLine drawing of Vostok capsule\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\nThe International Space Station, crewed since November 2000, is a joint venture between Russia, the United States, Canada and several other countries.\n\n\nSpaceplanes[edit]\n\nMain article: Spaceplane\n\n  \nColumbia orbiter landing\n\n\n\nSome reusable vehicles have been designed only for crewed spaceflight, and these are often called spaceplanes. The first example of such was the North American X-15 spaceplane, which conducted two crewed flights which reached an altitude of over 100\u00a0km in the 1960s.  The first reusable spacecraft, the X-15, was air-launched on a suborbital trajectory on July 19, 1963.\n\nThe first partially reusable orbital spacecraft, a winged non-capsule, the Space Shuttle, was launched by the USA on the 20th anniversary of Yuri Gagarin's flight, on April 12, 1981. During the Shuttle era, six orbiters were built, all of which have flown in the atmosphere and five of which have flown in space. Enterprise was used only for approach and landing tests, launching from the back of a Boeing 747 SCA and gliding to deadstick landings at Edwards AFB, California. The first Space Shuttle to fly into space was Columbia, followed by Challenger, Discovery, Atlantis, and Endeavour. Endeavour was built to replace Challenger when it was lost in January 1986. Columbia broke up during reentry in February 2003.\n\nThe first automatic partially reusable spacecraft was the Buran-class shuttle, launched by the USSR on November 15, 1988, although it made only one flight and this was uncrewed. This spaceplane was designed for a crew and strongly resembled the U.S. Space Shuttle, although its drop-off boosters used liquid propellants and its main engines were located at the base of what would be the external tank in the American Shuttle. Lack of funding, complicated by the dissolution of the USSR, prevented any further flights of Buran. The Space Shuttle was subsequently modified to allow for autonomous re-entry in case of necessity.\n\nPer the Vision for Space Exploration, the Space Shuttle was retired in 2011 due mainly to its old age and high cost of program reaching over a billion dollars per flight. The Shuttle's human transport role is to be replaced by SpaceX's Dragon V2 and Boeing's CST-100 Starliner no later than 2017. The Shuttle's heavy cargo transport role is to be replaced by expendable rockets such as the Space Launch System and SpaceX's Falcon Heavy.\n\nScaled Composites' SpaceShipOne was a reusable suborbital spaceplane that carried pilots Mike Melvill and Brian Binnie on consecutive flights in 2004 to win the Ansari X Prize. The Spaceship Company will build its successor SpaceShipTwo. A fleet of SpaceShipTwos operated by Virgin Galactic was planned to begin reusable private spaceflight carrying paying passengers in 2014, but was delayed after the crash of VSS Enterprise.\n\n\nUnmanned spacecraft[edit]\n\nSee also: List of unmanned spacecraft by program, Timeline of spaceflight, Timeline of artificial satellites and space probes, List of Solar System probes, Space probe, Robotic spacecraft, Unmanned resupply spacecraft, and Satellite\n\n  \nHubble Space Telescope\n\n\n\n  \nJules Verne Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) approaches the International Space Station on Monday, March 31, 2008\n\n\n\n  \nMariner 10 diagram of trajectory past planet Venus\n\n\n\n\t\tThis section needs expansion.

Spacecraft subsystems comprise the spacecraft's \"bus\" and may include attitude determination and control (variously called ADAC, ADC, or ACS), guidance, navigation and control (GNC or GN&C), communications (comms), command and data handling (CDH or C&DH), power (EPS), thermal control (TCS), propulsion, and structures. Attached to the bus are typically payloads.\n\n\n\tLife support\n\tSpacecraft intended for human spaceflight must also include a life support system for the crew.\n\n\n  \nReaction control system thrusters on the front of the U.S. Space Shuttle\n\n\n\n\tAttitude control\n\tA Spacecraft needs an attitude control subsystem to be correctly oriented in space and respond to external torques and forces properly. The attitude control subsystem consists of sensors and actuators, together with controlling algorithms. The attitude-control subsystem permits proper pointing for the science objective, sun pointing for power to the solar arrays and earth pointing for communications.\n\n\n\tGNC\n\tGuidance refers to the calculation of the commands (usually done by the CDH subsystem) needed to steer the spacecraft where it is desired to be. Navigation means determining a spacecraft's orbital elements or position. Control means adjusting the path of the spacecraft to meet mission requirements.\n\n\n\tCommand and data handling\n\tThe CDH subsystem receives commands from the communications subsystem, performs validation and decoding of the commands, and distributes the commands to the appropriate spacecraft subsystems and components. The CDH also receives housekeeping data and science data from the other spacecraft subsystems and components, and packages the data for storage on a data recorder or transmission to the ground via the communications subsystem. Other functions of the CDH include maintaining the spacecraft clock and state-of-health monitoring.\n\n\nFurther information: On-Board Data Handling\n\n\tCommunications\n\tSpacecraft, both robotic and crewed, utilize various communications systems for communication with terrestrial stations as well as for communication between spacecraft in space. Technologies utilized include RF and optical communication. In addition, some spacecraft payloads are explicitly for the purpose of ground\u2013ground communication using receiver/retransmitter electronic technologies.\n\n\n\tPower\n\tSpacecraft need an electrical power generation and distribution subsystem for powering the various spacecraft subsystems. For spacecraft near the Sun, solar panels are frequently used to generate electrical power. Spacecraft designed to operate in more distant locations, for example Jupiter, might employ a radioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTG) to generate electrical power. Electrical power is sent through power conditioning equipment before it passes through a power distribution unit over an electrical bus to other spacecraft components. Batteries are typically connected to the bus via a battery charge regulator, and the batteries are used to provide electrical power during periods when primary power is not available, for example when a low Earth orbit spacecraft is eclipsed by Earth.\n\n\n\tThermal control\n\tSpacecraft must be engineered to withstand transit through Earth's atmosphere and the space environment. They must operate in a vacuum with temperatures potentially ranging across hundreds of degrees Celsius as well as (if subject to reentry) in the presence of plasmas. Material requirements are such that either high melting temperature, low density materials such as beryllium and reinforced carbon\u2013carbon or (possibly due to the lower thickness requirements despite its high density) tungsten or ablative carbon\u2013carbon composites are used. Depending on mission profile, spacecraft may also need to operate on the surface of another planetary body. The thermal control subsystem can be passive, dependent on the selection of materials with specific radiative properties. Active thermal control makes use of electrical heaters and certain actuators such as louvers to control temperature ranges of equipments within specific ranges.\n\n\n\tSpacecraft propulsion\n\tSpacecraft may or may not have a propulsion subsystem, depending on whether or not the mission profile calls for propulsion. The Swift spacecraft is an example of a spacecraft that does not have a propulsion subsystem. Typically though, LEO spacecraft include a propulsion subsystem for altitude adjustments (drag make-up maneuvers) and inclination adjustment maneuvers. A propulsion system is also needed for spacecraft that perform momentum management maneuvers. Components of a conventional propulsion subsystem include fuel, tankage, valves, pipes, and thrusters. The thermal control system interfaces with the propulsion subsystem by monitoring the temperature of those components, and by preheating tanks and thrusters in preparation for a spacecraft maneuver.\n\n\n\tStructures\n\tSpacecraft must be engineered to withstand launch loads imparted by the launch vehicle, and must have a point of attachment for all the other subsystems. Depending on mission profile, the structural subsystem might need to withstand loads imparted by entry into the atmosphere of another planetary body, and landing on the surface of another planetary body.\n\n\n\tPayload\n\tThe payload depends on the mission of the spacecraft, and is typically regarded as the part of the spacecraft \"that pays the bills\". Typical payloads could include scientific instruments (cameras, telescopes, or particle detectors, for example), cargo, or a human crew.\n\n\n\tGround segment\n\n\nMain article: Ground segment\n\n\tThe ground segment, though not technically part of the spacecraft, is vital to the operation of the spacecraft. Typical components of a ground segment in use during normal operations include a mission operations facility where the flight operations team conducts the operations of the spacecraft, a data processing and storage facility, ground stations to radiate signals to and receive signals from the spacecraft, and a voice and data communications network to connect all mission elements.[17]\n\n\n\tLaunch vehicle\n\tThe launch vehicle propels the spacecraft from Earth's surface, through the atmosphere, and into an orbit, the exact orbit being dependent on the mission configuration. The launch vehicle may be expendable or reusable.\n\n\nSee also[edit]\n\n\n\tSpaceflight portal\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\n\tAstrionics\n\tFlying saucer\n\tList of fictional spacecraft\n\tNewSpace\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\n\tSpacecraft design\n\tSpace exploration\n\tSpace launch\n\tSpace suit\n\n\n \n\n\n\t\n\tSpaceflight records\n\tStarship\n\tTimeline of Solar System exploration\n\tU.S. Space Exploration History on U.S. Stamps\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\nNotes\n\n\n\n\t^ Adams, Sam (29 August 2016). \"Taiwanese navy fires NUCLEAR MISSILE at fisherman during horrifying accident\".\n\n\t^ \"At Mach-10, Taiwan's Hsiung Feng-III 'Anti-China' Missiles could be faster than the BrahMos\". defencenews.in.

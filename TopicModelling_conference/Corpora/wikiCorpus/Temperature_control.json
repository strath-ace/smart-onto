(September 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\n\n\n\n  \nTemperature measuring and controlling module for microcontroller experiment\n\n\n\nTemperature control is a process in which change of temperature of a space (and objects collectively there within), or of a substance, is  measured or otherwise detected, and the passage of heat energy into or out of the space or substance is adjusted to achieve a desired temperature. \n\nAir-conditioners, space-heaters, refrigerators, water-heaters, etc. are examples of devices that perform temperature control. These are often broadly classified as Thermostatically Controlled Loads (TCLs). \n\n\nControl loops[edit]\n\nA home thermostat is an example of a closed control loop: It constantly measures the current room temperature and compares this to a desired user-defined set point and controls a heater and/or air conditioner to increase or decrease the temperature to meet the desired set point. A simple (low-cost, cheap) thermostat merely switches the heater or air conditioner either on or off, and temporary overshoot and undershoot of the desired average temperature must be expected. A more expensive thermostat varies the amount of heat or cooling provided by the heater or cooler, depending on the difference between the required temperature (the \"setpoint\") and the actual temperature. This minimizes over/undershoot. This method is called Proportional control. Further enhancements using the accumulated error signal (integral) and the rate at which the error is changing (derivative) are used to form more complex PID Controllers, which is the form usually seen in industrial settings.\n\n\nEnergy balance[edit]\n\nAn object's or space's temperature increases when heat energy moves into it, increasing the average kinetic energy of its atoms, e.g., of things and air in a room.  Heat energy leaving an object or space lowers its temperature.  Heat flows from one place to another (always from a higher temperature to a lower one) by one or more of three processes: conduction, convection and radiation. In conduction, energy is passed from one atom to another by direct contact. In convection, heat energy moves by conduction into some movable fluid (such as air or water) and the fluid moves from one place to another, carrying the heat with it.  At some point the heat energy in the fluid is usually transferred to some other object by means conduction again.  The movement of the fluid can be driven by negative-buoyancy, as when cooler (and therefore denser) air drops and thus upwardly displaces warmer (less-dense) air (natural convection), or by fans or pumps (forced convection).  In radiation, the heated atoms make electromagnetic emissions absorbed by remote other atoms, whether nearby or at astronomical distance. For example, the Sun radiates heat as both invisible and visible electromagnetic energy. What we know as \"light\" is but a narrow region of the electromagnetic spectrum.\n\nIf, in a place or thing, more energy is  received than is lost, its temperature increases.  If the amount of energy coming in and going out are exactly the same, the temperature stays constant\u2014there is thermal balance, or thermal equilibrium.\n\n\nSee also[edit]\n\n\tHeat exchanger\n\tMoving bed heat exchanger\n\tThermal Control System\n\tThermodynamic equilibrium\n\tIndustrial automation\n\tSpacecraft thermal control\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\tRetrieved from \"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Temperature_control&oldid=909101540\"\n\n\t\t\n\t\tCategories: \tTemperature control\n\n\nHidden categories: \tArticles lacking in-text citations from September 2015\n\tAll articles lacking in-text citations\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\tNavigation menu\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tPersonal tools\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNot logged in\n\tTalk\n\tContributions\n\tCreate account\n\tLog in\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tNamespaces\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tArticle\n\tTalk\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tVariants\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tViews\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead\n\tEdit\n\tView history\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMore\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSearch\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tNavigation\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMain page\n\tContents\n\tFeatured content\n\tCurrent events\n\tRandom article\n\tDonate to Wikipedia\n\tWikipedia store\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tInteraction\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHelp\n\tAbout Wikipedia\n\tCommunity portal\n\tRecent changes\n\tContact page\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tTools\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat links here\n\tRelated changes\n\tUpload file\n\tSpecial pages\n\tPermanent link\n\tPage information\n\tWikidata item\n\tCite this page\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tPrint/export\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCreate a book\n\tDownload as PDF\n\tPrintable version\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tLanguages\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u0627\u0631\u062f\u0648\n\n\n\t\t\t\tEdit links\n\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t This page was last edited on 3 August 2019, at 02:53\u00a0(UTC).\n\tText is available under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License;\nadditional terms may apply.

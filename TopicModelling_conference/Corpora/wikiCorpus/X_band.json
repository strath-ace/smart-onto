In some cases, such as in communication engineering, the frequency range of the X band is rather indefinitely set at approximately 7.0\u201311.2\u00a0GHz.[citation needed] In radar engineering, the frequency range is specified by the IEEE at 8.0\u201312.0\u00a0GHz. The X band is used for radar, satellite communication, and wireless computer networks.\n\n\nContents\n\n\n\t1 Radar\n\t2 Terrestrial communications and networking\n\t3 Space communications\n\t3.1 X band NATO frequency requirements\n\n\n\n\t4 Amateur radio\n\t5 Other uses\n\t6 See also\n\t7 References\n\t8 External links\n\n\n\n\n\nRadar[edit]\n\n  \nAn X-Band marine radar antenna on a ship.\n\n\n\nX band is used in radar applications including continuous-wave, pulsed, single-polarization, dual-polarization, synthetic aperture radar, and phased arrays. X band radar frequency sub-bands are used in civil, military, and government institutions for weather monitoring, air traffic control, maritime vessel traffic control, defense tracking, and vehicle speed detection for law enforcement.[1]\n\nX band is often used in modern radars. The shorter wavelengths of the X band allow for higher resolution imagery from high-resolution imaging radars for target identification and discrimination.\n\n\nTerrestrial communications and networking[edit]\n\nIn Ireland, Libya, Saudi Arabia and Canada[citation needed], the X band 10.15 to 10.7 segment is used for terrestrial broadband. Alvarion, CBNL, CableFree and Ogier make systems for this, though each has a proprietary airlink. The Ogier system is a full duplex Transverter used for DOCSIS over microwave. The home / Business CPE has a single coaxial cable with a power adapter connecting to an ordinary cable modem. The local oscillator is usually 9750\u00a0MHz, the same as for Ku band satellite TV LNB. Two way applications such as broadband typically use a 350\u00a0MHz TX offset.\n\n\nSpace communications[edit]\n\nFurther information: X Band Satellite Communication\n\n  \n70 meter X-band spacecraft communication antenna of the NASA Deep Space Network in Canberra, Australia.\n\n\n\nPortions of the X band are assigned by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) exclusively for deep space telecommunications. The primary user of this allocation is the American NASA Deep Space Network (DSN)[citation needed]. DSN facilities are  in Goldstone, California (in the Mojave Desert), near Canberra, Australia, and near Madrid, Spain.\n\nThese three stations, located approximately 120 degrees apart in longitude, provide continual communications from the Earth to almost any point in the Solar System independent of Earth rotation. DSN stations are capable of using the older and lower S band deep-space radio communications allocations, and some higher frequencies on a more-or-less experimental basis, such as in the K band.\n\nNotable deep space probe programs that have employed X band communications include the Viking Mars landers; the Voyager missions to Jupiter, Saturn, and beyond; the Galileo Jupiter orbiter; the New Horizons mission to Pluto and the Kuiper belt, the Curiosity rover and the Cassini-Huygens Saturn orbiter.\n\nThe new European double Mars Mission ExoMars will also use X band communication, on the instrument LaRa, to study the internal structure of Mars, and to make precise measurements of the rotation and orientation of Mars by monitoring two-way Doppler frequency shifts between the surface platform and Earth. It will also detect variations in angular momentum due to the redistribution of masses, such as the migration of ice from the polar caps to the atmosphere.\n\nAn important use of the X band communications came with the two Viking program landers. When the planet Mars was passing near or behind the Sun, as seen from the Earth, a Viking lander would transmit two simultaneous continuous-wave carriers, one in the S band and one in the X band in the direction of the Earth, where they were picked up by DSN ground stations. By making simultaneous measurements at the two different frequencies, the resulting data enabled theoretical physicists to verify the mathematical predictions of Albert Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. These results are some of the best confirmations of the General Theory of Relativity.\n\n\nX band NATO frequency requirements[edit]\n\nThe International Telecommunications Union (ITU), the international body which allocates radio frequencies for civilian use, is not  authorised to allocate frequency bands for military radio communication.  This is also the case pertaining to X band military communications satellites. However, in order to meet military radio spectrum requirements, e.g. for fixed-satellite service and mobile-satellite service, the NATO nations negotiated the so-called NATO Joint Civil/Military Frequency Agreement (NJFA).[2]\n\n\n\t(a)\t(b)\t(c)\t(d)\n\n\t\n\n\t7250-7750\nMHz\n\tFIXED\nFIXED-SATELLlTE (s-E), \nMOBILE-SATELLlTE (s-E) \n(S5.461)\n\t1.

This is known as the 3-centimeter band by amateurs and the X-band by AMSAT.\n\n\nOther uses[edit]\n\nMotion detectors often use 10.525\u00a0GHz.[4]  10.4\u00a0GHz is proposed for traffic light crossing detectors.\nComreg in Ireland has allocated 10.450\u00a0GHz for Traffic Sensors as SRD.[5]\n\nMany electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometers operate near 9.8\u00a0GHz.\n\nParticle accelerators may be powered by X-band RF sources. The frequencies are then standardized at 11.9942\u00a0GHz (Europe) or 11.424\u00a0GHz (US),[6][7] which is the second harmonic of C-band and fourth harmonic of S-band. The European X-band frequency is used for the Compact Linear Collider (CLIC).\n\n\nSee also[edit]\n\n\tCassegrain reflector\n\tDirectional antenna\n\tXTAR\n\tSea-based X band Radar\n\tNew Horizons telecommunications\n\tVoyager program#Spacecraft design\n\tEarth observation satellites transmission frequencies\n\tTerraSAR-X: a German Earth observation satellite\n\n\nReferences[edit]\n\n\t\n\tThis article needs additional citations for verification.

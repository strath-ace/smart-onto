The Ground Segment (GS) shall be capable of planning and controlling the mission and of operating the satellite under all expected conditions. | ground_segment
The GS shall be capable of acquiring the X Band satellite data. | ground_segment
The satellite Telemetry data routed via the X-band channel shall be assembled (acquired and formatted) by the PLM, and shall include: PLM measurement data (Science data) = CORR-TM,composed of the MIRAS correlators outputs,PLM Instrument house-keeping = I-HKTM, including – inter alia – instrument mode information,A set of Platform house-keeping parameters = SC-HKTM,needed by the PLM and/or the DPGS, and including satellite time, attitude and position/velocity/time (PVT) information(known as PROTEUS bulletins). PLM PUS Telecommands house-keeping data = PUS-HKTM,as generated by the implementation of PUS services. | ground_segment
The GS shall be capable of processing the satellite data up to Level 2 included for its own purposes and for delivery to the users. | ground_segment
GS shall be composed of five basic functional elements:The S Band TT&C Earth Terminal at Kiruna (TTCET); The satellite Command and Control Centre in Toulouse (CCC); The X Band Data Acquisition Element in Villafranca (XBAS); The processing and archiving element in Villafranca (PDPC).The payload Operation Programming Center (PLPC). | ground_segment
The mission shall use and be compatible with the standards of the ESA deep space network as well as the NASA deep space network. | ground_segment
During LEOP, TBD ESA ground stations shall be used for contact with the spacecraft. | ground_segment
The ground segment shall provide for a 24 hour coverage capability for asteroid descent, touchdown, sampling and local characterization operations. | ground_segment
The ground segment shall cope with the data volume defined in R-SYS410/420/430. | ground_segment
The ground segment shall support the on-orbit calibration of the satellite autonomous pointing capabilities. | ground_segment
